# LangSight — Build Progress

> Last updated: 2026-03-20 (session detail page, shared SVG lineage graph, agent topology, `/lineage` redirect, docs sync)
> Maintained by: docs-keeper agent — update after every feature, architectural decision, or milestone

**Project framing**: LangSight is complete observability for everything an AI agent calls — MCP servers, HTTP APIs, Python functions, and sub-agents. Agent-level instrumentation captures all tool types in one trace. MCP servers additionally receive proactive health checks, security scanning, schema drift detection, and alerting because the MCP protocol is standard and inspectable. Non-MCP tools (HTTP APIs, functions) are passively observed in traces only.

## v0.2.0 Dashboard UX Changes (2026-03-20)

### Session debugging moved to a dedicated page

- `/sessions/[id]` is now the primary session debugging surface
- Two tabs:
  - `Details` — timeline + interactive lineage graph + right-side detail panel
  - `Trace` — nested span tree with inline payload and error expansion
- Replay and session comparison are now initiated from the session detail page rather than the older sessions-table workflow

### Shared lineage graph renderer

- React Flow has been replaced with a shared raw SVG + `dagre` renderer in `dashboard/components/lineage-graph.tsx`
- The same renderer now powers:
  - session-level flow inspection
  - per-agent topology on the Agents page
  - fleet-wide topology in the Agents page modal
- `/lineage` now redirects to `/agents`; topology exploration is consolidated under the Agents experience

## v0.2.0 Infrastructure Changes (2026-03-19)

### SQLite removed — DualStorage is the production topology

| Change | Details |
|--------|---------|
| `storage/sqlite.py` | DELETED — `SQLiteBackend` no longer exists |
| `storage/dual.py` | NEW — `DualStorage` routes metadata → Postgres, analytics → ClickHouse |
| `storage/factory.py` | Updated — `open_storage()` dispatches `mode="dual"` (default); raises `ConfigError` on `mode="sqlite"` with migration message |
| `config.py` `StorageConfig.mode` | Default changed from `"sqlite"` → `"dual"` |
| `docker-compose.yml` | Postgres port 5432 + ClickHouse 8123/9000 exposed to host; `${VAR:?error}` required-var enforcement; `.env.example` added |

### SDK auth header fix (CRITICAL)

SDK was sending `Authorization: Bearer <key>`, API only read `X-API-Key`. Traces were silently dropped in authenticated deployments. Fixed in `dependencies.py` via `_read_api_key()` which now reads both headers. SDK now sends `X-API-Key`. Both forms permanently accepted.

### Proxy trust — CIDR-based (was hardcoded loopback)

`LANGSIGHT_TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS` env var (default: `127.0.0.1/32,::1/128`; Docker default: adds `172.16.0.0/12,10.0.0.0/8`). `parse_trusted_proxy_networks()` + `_is_proxy_request()` in `dependencies.py`. Previously hardcoded `{127.0.0.1, ::1}` — broken for Docker deployments where Next.js runs in a separate container.

### Alert config + audit logs persisted to DB

- `alert_config` — Postgres singleton upsert; previously in `app.state` (lost on restart)
- `audit_logs` — Postgres append-only table; previously in-memory ring buffer (lost on restart)
- `append_audit()` uses `asyncio.create_task` — never blocks request path

### RBAC hardened

- API key CRUD endpoints now require admin role
- SLO write endpoints now require admin role
- `list_projects` session-user path fixed
- `get_active_project_id` and `get_project_access` check DB keys for auth-disabled logic

### Integration test infrastructure

- `tests/conftest.py`: `require_postgres`, `require_clickhouse`, `require_all_services` fixtures with auto-skip
- `tests/integration/storage/test_postgres_storage.py`: full Postgres tests against real DB
- Regression tests migrated from SQLiteBackend to PostgresBackend

### Test metrics (v0.2.0)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Unit tests | 694 |
| Coverage | 77% (threshold: 75%) |
| ruff | All checks passed |
| mypy | Success: no issues (68 source files) |

## Security Assessment — Action Required (2026-03-18)

A security review was conducted against the codebase as of 2026-03-18. The overall assessment is: **strong OSS alpha with critical gaps that must be resolved before production positioning**.

### P0 — Blockers (must fix before any public deployment)

| ID | Finding | Location |
|----|---------|----------|
| P0.1 | API is unauthenticated | `api/main.py` line 56 (wildcard CORS), no auth dependency on routers line 63. Anyone who can reach port 8000 can trigger scans, ingest spans, and read all data. |
| P0.2 | Dashboard auth is demo-only | `dashboard/lib/auth.ts` — hardcoded users, any password accepted, static secret fallback. UI appears productized; identity layer is not. |

### P1 — Important (fix before broader adoption)

| ID | Finding | Location |
|----|---------|----------|
| P1.1 | Docker Compose uses insecure defaults | ClickHouse default user, default Postgres password, databases exposed to host network, known dashboard secret as default value |
| P1.2 | README overstates production completeness | Claims per-session costs in sessions output, but cost field is absent from `langsight sessions` CLI; cost engine `total` is a placeholder |

### Production Readiness Gaps

The following items are required before LangSight can be positioned as production-grade:

| # | Gap | Priority |
|---|-----|----------|
| 1 | Real authn/authz for API (API keys or OIDC) and dashboard | P0 |
| 2 | Hardened deployment assets — no default secrets, no public DB ports, TLS, secret injection | P1 |
| 3 | Schema migration strategy — Alembic for Postgres, ClickHouse migration tooling | P1 |
| 4 | Honest feature matrix — separate shipped features from roadmap items | P1 |
| 5 | Operational hardening — rate limiting, audit logging, Prometheus metrics, readiness/liveness probes | P1 |
| 6 | Security posture docs — threat model, deployment topology, vulnerability disclosure policy | P1 |

### Current Honest Positioning

LangSight v0.1.0 is a **promising self-hosted observability and security toolkit for MCP and agent workflows**. It is suitable for:
- Local development and experimentation
- Internal pilots within trusted networks
- Contributor adoption and OSS evaluation

It is **not yet suitable** for internet-facing or multi-tenant deployment without the P0/P1 gaps above resolved.

## Phase 5 — Deep Observability: Gap Analysis (2026-03-18)

A thorough code review identified a set of high-value observability features that are implied by the product vision but not yet built. These form Phase 5.

### Gap Table

| Feature | Gap Severity | Blocks |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Input/output payload capture (P5.1) | ✅ Implemented (2026-03-18) | P5.2, P5.6, P5.7 |
| Session replay trace tree UI (P5.2) | ✅ Implemented (2026-03-19) | Debugging workflows |
| LLM reasoning capture (P5.3) | ✅ Implemented (2026-03-19) | Full session context |
| Statistical anomaly detection (P5.4) | ✅ Implemented (2026-03-19) | Proactive incident detection |
| Agent SLO tracking (P5.5) | ✅ Implemented (2026-03-19) | SLO-based alerting |
| Side-by-side session comparison (P5.6) | ✅ Implemented (2026-03-19) | Playground replay |
| Playground replay (P5.7) | ✅ Implemented (2026-03-19) | Iterative debugging |

### What IS built (confirmed from code review)

- `ToolCallSpan` fields: `span_id`, `parent_span_id`, `span_type` (`tool_call`/`agent`/`handoff`), `trace_id`, `session_id`, `server_name`, `tool_name`, `started_at`, `ended_at`, `latency_ms`, `status`, `error`, `agent_name`
- ClickHouse `mcp_tool_calls` table with all the above columns
- `mv_tool_reliability` materialized view (hourly aggregates: `success_rate`, `avg_latency`, `error_calls`)
- `mv_agent_sessions` materialized view (per-session: `tool_calls`, `failed_calls`, `duration_ms`, `servers_used`)
- `get_session_trace(session_id)` — returns flat span list ordered by time (tree reconstruction done by caller)
- `get_agent_sessions()` — session list with aggregates
- `get_tool_reliability()` — tool metrics from MV
- `MCPClientProxy.call_tool()` — captures timing, status, error — **NOT args/result**
- SDK sends spans fire-and-forget via `asyncio.create_task`
- OTLP parser extracts MCP spans from OTLP/JSON payloads; extracts `gen_ai.agent.name` but **not prompt/completion content**
- Cost engine: `get_cost_call_counts()` groups by server/tool/agent/session

### What is NOT built (the gaps)

- ~~`input_args` and `output_result` fields on `ToolCallSpan`~~ — **built (P5.1, 2026-03-18)**: `input_args`/`output_result` on `ToolCallSpan`; `input_json`/`output_json` columns in ClickHouse `mcp_tool_calls`; `redact_payloads` config flag
- ~~LLM reasoning capture (`gen_ai.prompt`, `gen_ai.completion`) not extracted from OTLP spans~~ — **built (P5.3, 2026-03-19)**: OTLP spans with `gen_ai.prompt`/`gen_ai.completion` (or `llm.prompts`/`llm.completions`) are parsed into agent spans with `llm_input`/`llm_output`; "Prompt"/"Completion" panels visible in session trace tree; `intValue`/`doubleValue`/`boolValue` OTLP attributes now also handled
- ~~No confirmed dashboard UI that renders a session as a visual trace timeline/tree~~ — **built (P5.2, 2026-03-19)**: sessions page trace tree now shows inline payload panels per span; `SpanNode` API and TypeScript type include `input_json`/`output_json`
- ~~No statistical baseline learning — alerts are purely threshold-based~~ — **built (P5.4, 2026-03-19)**: `AnomalyDetector` computes z-score per tool against 7-day ClickHouse baseline; `warning` at |z|>=2, `critical` at |z|>=3; minimum stddev guards prevent false positives; `GET /api/reliability/anomalies` endpoint; dashboard "Anomalies Detected" card with critical/warning breakdown
- ~~No `AgentSLO` model, no SLO evaluator, no burn rate calculation~~ — **built (P5.5, 2026-03-19)**: `SLOMetric` StrEnum, `AgentSLO` and `SLOEvaluation` Pydantic models; `agent_slos` table in SQLite and PostgreSQL; `SLOEvaluator` evaluates session data; `success_rate` = clean/total sessions; `latency_p99` uses `max(duration_ms)` as conservative proxy; `/api/slos` CRUD; dashboard Overview "Agent SLOs" panel; CLI commands deferred
- ~~No session comparison API endpoint or UI~~ — **built (P5.6, 2026-03-19, refined 2026-03-20)**: `compare_sessions()` on ClickHouse backend; `GET /api/agents/sessions/compare?a=&b=` endpoint; comparison now runs from the dedicated `/sessions/[id]` page and renders an inline side-by-side diff table with matched/diverged/only-in-one-session states and latency deltas
- ~~No playground replay~~ — **built (P5.7, 2026-03-19, refined 2026-03-20)**: `ReplayEngine` in `src/langsight/replay/engine.py`; `replay_of` field on `ToolCallSpan` and `mcp_tool_calls`; `POST /api/agents/sessions/{id}/replay` endpoint; Replay action now lives on the dedicated session detail page

### Implementation Order and Rationale

The order is determined by dependency. P5.1 is the foundation — without payload capture, session replay (P5.2), comparison (P5.6), and replay (P5.7) are all blocked or severely limited. P5.3, P5.4, and P5.5 are independent and can proceed in parallel once P5.1 is done. P5.6 requires P5.1. P5.7 requires both P5.1 and P5.6.

```
P5.1 (Payload Capture)
  ├── P5.2 (Session Replay UI)         — blocked on P5.1
  ├── P5.3 (LLM Reasoning Capture)     — independent, can run in parallel
  ├── P5.4 (Anomaly Detection)         — independent, can run in parallel
  ├── P5.5 (SLO Tracking)              — independent, can run in parallel
  └── P5.6 (Session Comparison)        — blocked on P5.1
        └── P5.7 (Playground Replay)   — blocked on P5.1 + P5.6
```

---

## Phase 6 — Project-Level RBAC: Planned (2026-03-19)

A project is the top-level isolation boundary. Every piece of observability data belongs to a project. Users hold project-level roles (`owner`, `member`, `viewer`). Global admins retain cross-project visibility. Non-members receive HTTP 404 on any project endpoint to prevent enumeration.

### Sub-phases

| ID | Description | Status |
|----|-------------|--------|
| P6.1 | Data model — `Project`, `ProjectMember` Pydantic models; `projects` + `project_members` tables; `project_id` columns on `mcp_tool_calls`, `agent_slos`, `api_keys`; Alembic migration | NOT STARTED |
| P6.2 | Storage layer — project + member CRUD protocol methods; implemented on `SQLiteBackend` and `PostgresBackend` | NOT STARTED |
| P6.3 | API middleware — `get_project` dependency (404 for non-members, global admin bypass); `require_project_role` factory; `/api/projects` router with 9 endpoints | NOT STARTED |
| P6.4 | Scope existing endpoints — optional `project_id` query param on sessions, reliability, costs, SLOs, and traces ingestion endpoints | NOT STARTED |
| P6.5 | SDK — `project_id` param on `LangSightClient`; propagated to every `ToolCallSpan` | NOT STARTED |
| P6.6 | Dashboard — project switcher in sidebar; active project in localStorage; Settings > Projects tab for create/invite/manage | NOT STARTED |
| P6.7 | Bootstrap — `_bootstrap_default_project()` creates "Default" project with admin as owner on first API startup; idempotent | NOT STARTED |

---

## Phase 7 — Model-Based Cost Tracking: Planned (2026-03-19)

Token-aware cost engine. LLM spans carry `input_tokens`/`output_tokens`/`model_id` from OTLP attributes and are priced against a managed `model_pricing` table seeded with 16 models across Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Meta, and AWS. Non-LLM tool spans continue to use the existing call-based `CostRule` pricing from `.langsight.yaml`. The costs breakdown response splits `llm_cost_usd` from `tool_cost_usd`. Settings page adds a model pricing management table. Costs page adds a "By Model" token breakdown.

### Sub-phases

| ID | Description | Status |
|----|-------------|--------|
| P7.1 | `model_pricing` table + 16 seed rows + `StorageBackend` protocol methods; Alembic migration | NOT STARTED |
| P7.2 | `input_tokens`, `output_tokens`, `model_id` fields on `ToolCallSpan`; ClickHouse DDL; OTLP parser extraction | NOT STARTED |
| P7.3 | `ModelPricingLookup` helper; token-based vs call-based cost routing; `project_id` scoping on all cost endpoints; `llm_cost_usd`/`tool_cost_usd` split in response | NOT STARTED |
| P7.4 | `GET /api/costs/models`, `POST /api/costs/models`, `PATCH /api/costs/models/{id}`, `DELETE /api/costs/models/{id}` — admin-gated CRUD with audit trail | NOT STARTED |
| P7.5 | Dashboard Settings: `ModelPricingSection` component — table grouped by provider, inline edit, "Add custom model" modal | NOT STARTED |
| P7.6 | Dashboard Costs: "LLM Tokens Cost" + "Tool Calls Cost" summary cards; "By Model" token breakdown table | NOT STARTED |

## Phase 4 — 85% Complete (POST-0.1.0)

**Note**: Marketing website (`website/`) and product dashboard (`dashboard/`) shipped post-0.1.0. Both are built. Website awaits Vercel deployment. Dashboard auth now runs through NextAuth + the authenticated proxy path; current follow-up work is UX/documentation alignment rather than demo-auth removal.

## Key Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale | Date |
|----------|-----------|------|
| CLI-first (Phase 1) | Fastest path to value, no infra required | 2026-03-16 |
| SQLite for local mode | Zero-dependency local storage, no Docker needed for users | 2026-03-16 |
| MCP Python SDK for transport | Use official SDK instead of raw JSON-RPC | 2026-03-16 |
| asyncio.gather for concurrent checks | Health check N servers in parallel, not sequentially | 2026-03-16 |
| Module-level globals for MCP connections | Simpler than FastMCP context API, works reliably | 2026-03-16 |
| test-mcps built with skills | Used python-mcp-server-generator + mcp-builder + docker-expert | 2026-03-16 |
| FastAPI REST API in Phase 1 (ahead of plan) | Needed for `langsight serve`; adds no deps already in use | 2026-03-17 |
| PostgresBackend + open_storage() factory in Phase 1 | Required to make API testable without Docker | 2026-03-17 |
| **SDK-first before OTEL** | Engineers won't configure OTEL collectors before seeing value. Langfuse grew via `from langfuse.openai import OpenAI`. We need the same 2-line integration path. | 2026-03-17 |
| **LibreChat plugin, not OTEL** | LibreChat does not emit OTEL natively — it uses env vars for Langfuse. Following the same pattern (`LANGSIGHT_URL`) is lower friction and requires no LibreChat core changes. | 2026-03-17 |
| **Framework adapters alongside SDK** | CrewAI and Pydantic AI users should not need to find and wrap the MCP client manually — adapter objects are more idiomatic in those frameworks. | 2026-03-17 |
| **OTEL + ClickHouse moved to Phase 3** | Infrastructure tier comes after SDK proves adoption. Teams that already run OTEL can point at LangSight's collector in Phase 3 with zero code changes. | 2026-03-17 |
| **Ship 0.1.0 before dashboard** | CLI + SDK + API + docs cover 100% of the value proposition for OSS adopters. Dashboard adds frontend complexity and blocks release by 2-4 weeks. Ship what works; dashboard follows in Phase 4. | 2026-03-17 |
