Phase 11 (Catalogs + Graph UX)  ████████████████ 100% — COMPLETE ✅ 2026-03-20
```

**Shipped metrics (v0.2.0)**: 694 unit tests, 77% coverage (threshold 75%), ruff `All checks passed`, mypy `Success: no issues found in 68 source files`. Full dashboard redesign with Geist fonts + deep dark sidebar, marketing website with /security and /pricing pages, projects management UI.

**Phase 11 changes (shipped 2026-03-20)**:
- Session detail page: graph toolbar (search, zoom slider 25-250%, expand/collapse, failures toggle), minimap (150×90px, draggable viewport), timeline bar (colored segments per tool call, click to select node), PayloadSlideout component (full-width slide-over, line numbers, copy, word wrap, Esc to close), per-tool edge expansion (circular `+` button with call count), "View in Catalog" links from node panels. Keyboard shortcuts: `/` search, `f` fit, `e` error toggle, `+`/`-` zoom, `Esc` deselect.
- Agents catalog: 3-state adaptive layout — State 1 (full-width sortable table + Needs Attention banner), State 2 (280px sidebar + detail panel with About/Overview/Topology/Sessions tabs), State 3 (56px icon rail + full-width topology graph). Editable metadata (description, owner, tags, status, runbook URL) persisted via `agent_metadata` table.
- MCP Servers catalog at `/servers`: same 3-state layout; detail panel has About/Tools/Health/Consumers tabs; "MCP Servers" added to sidebar primary nav between Agents and Costs.
- New PostgreSQL tables: `server_metadata`, `server_tools`.
- New API endpoints: `GET/PUT /api/servers/metadata`, `GET/PUT /api/servers/{name}/tools`.
- SDK: `MCPClientProxy.list_tools()` intercepted — tool schemas fire-and-forget posted to backend; Tools tab populates automatically without health checker.

**Prometheus metrics + SSE live feed (2026-03-21)**:
- Prometheus `/metrics` endpoint: `src/langsight/api/metrics.py` — `GET /metrics` no auth, 6 metrics (http_requests_total, http_request_duration_seconds, spans_ingested_total, active_sse_connections, health_checks_total, storage_pool_size), `PrometheusMiddleware` instruments all requests with path normalization. New dep: `prometheus-client>=0.21`.
- SSE live event feed: `src/langsight/api/broadcast.py` (`SSEBroadcaster` in-memory pub/sub, max 200 clients, 50-event buffer per client, 15s keepalive) + `src/langsight/api/routers/live.py` (`GET /api/live/events`, auth required). Event types: `span:new` (on trace ingestion), `health:check` (on health check completion). `traces.py` calls `broadcaster.publish()` after span storage.
- 20 new tests (11 metrics + 9 broadcaster). Total: 957 tests passing.

**SDK integrations + rate limiter fix (2026-03-21)**:
- Rate limiter: single global `Limiter` instance in `src/langsight/api/rate_limit.py`; all routers import from this module. Per-route overrides: traces=2000/min, otlp=60/min, accept-invite=5/min, verify=10/min. Previously each router created its own instance, preventing overrides from working.
- `ToolCallSpan.latency_ms` changed from required to optional (`float | None = None`); `model_validator(mode="after")` auto-computes from `ended_at - started_at` when omitted.
- 3 new SDK integrations: OpenAI Agents (`src/langsight/integrations/openai_agents.py`), Anthropic/Claude (`src/langsight/integrations/anthropic_sdk.py`), LangGraph (`src/langsight/integrations/langgraph.py`).
- 3 new docs-site pages: `openai-agents.mdx`, `anthropic.mdx`, `langgraph.mdx`. `mint.json` updated.
- Integration count: 9 (MCP, LangChain, LangGraph, CrewAI, Pydantic AI, OpenAI Agents, Anthropic/Claude, OTEL, LibreChat).

**Principal engineer audit fixes (2026-03-21)**:
- Security: removed AWS creds leak from docker-compose, DB ports bound to 127.0.0.1, CORS default tightened to `http://localhost:3003`, demo credentials gated behind `NODE_ENV !== "production"`, global rate limiting (200/min) on all endpoints, dashboard security headers added, PII masking in audit logs
- Correctness: DualStorage.accept_invite delegation fixed, delete metadata result check fixed, session compare handles null project_id, getServerHistory typo fixed
- Performance: health page lazy-loads history on row expand, agents page sessions limit 500->100 with staggered SWR, upsert_server_tools uses executemany()
- Docker: dashboard health check uses 127.0.0.1 (not localhost), HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0 for standalone mode, list_projects resolves caller's role
- CI: new "Dashboard Type Check" job runs `tsc --noEmit`
- Tests: DualStorage protocol conformance test, accept_invite routing test

**Infrastructure changes (2026-03-19)**:
- SQLite removed — `DualStorage` (Postgres + ClickHouse) is the only production topology; `factory.py` raises `ConfigError` on unknown/sqlite mode
- Integration test fixtures: `require_postgres`, `require_clickhouse`, `require_all_services` in `tests/conftest.py` — auto-skip when Docker is not running
- SDK auth header: SDK now sends `X-API-Key`; API accepts both `X-API-Key` and `Authorization: Bearer` via `_read_api_key()` helper
- Proxy trust: CIDR-based via `LANGSIGHT_TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS`; Docker default includes `172.16.0.0/12,10.0.0.0/8`
- Alert config + audit logs: persisted to Postgres (`alert_config` singleton + `audit_logs` append table); removed in-memory ring buffer
- RBAC: API key endpoints and SLO write endpoints now require admin role

**Settings improvements (shipped 2026-03-19)**: Settings page redesigned from single-scroll to left-nav + content panel with 8 isolated sections. New sections: Notifications (Slack webhook + 6 alert type toggles), Audit Logs (sourced from `audit_logs` Postgres table — no longer in-memory). New API endpoints: `GET/POST /api/alerts/config`, `POST /api/alerts/test`, `GET /api/audit/logs`. New alert types in `alerts/engine.py`: `AGENT_FAILURE`, `SLO_BREACHED`, `ANOMALY_DETECTED`, `SECURITY_FINDING`. Debug Information added to General section; `.env` SDK snippet added to API Keys section.

**Dashboard UX improvements (shipped 2026-03-19)**: Accept-invite page (`/accept-invite`) with public API route handler; NavProgress bar (thin indigo, fires on sidebar link click); `loading.tsx` App Router skeleton; sidebar route prefetch on mount; `health/page.tsx` `useState` → `useEffect` fix for HistoryPanel.

## 1. MVP Definition

> **Historical note**: Section 1 below was written under the original project name "LangSight" before the project was renamed to LangSight. CLI commands shown here (`langsight ...`, `pip install langsight`) reflect the original plan. The shipped product uses `langsight` as the CLI entry point and package name. This section is preserved as-is for historical traceability; see Section 2 onward for current implementation details.

### 1.1 What is IN the MVP

The MVP is a **CLI-first tool** that any engineer can install and run against their local MCP configuration. Docker Compose is required (`docker compose up -d` for PostgreSQL + ClickHouse).

| # | Feature | Description |
|---|---------|-------------|
| 1 | **MCP Discovery** | Auto-detect MCP servers from `claude_desktop_config.json`, `mcp.json`, `.cursor/mcp.json` |
| 2 | **Server Inventory** | List all MCP servers with transport type, status, tool count, version |
| 3 | **Health Checks** | Connect to each MCP server, call `tools/list`, validate response, measure latency |
| 4 | **Schema Snapshots** | Record tool input/output schemas in PostgreSQL, detect drift on subsequent runs |
| 5 | **Schema Diff** | Show breaking vs. non-breaking schema changes between snapshots |
| 6 | **Security Scanner (Basic)** | CVE scanning via OSV API, tool description injection detection, auth audit |
| 7 | **OWASP MCP Top 10 Checks** | Automated audit for the top 10 MCP security risks |
| 8 | **Health Scoring** | Composite 0-100 score per server based on availability, latency, schema stability |
| 9 | **CLI Interface** | `langsight inventory`, `langsight health check`, `langsight security scan`, `langsight schema diff` |
| 10 | **Local Storage** | PostgreSQL backend for schema history, scan results, health snapshots |
| 11 | **Webhook Alerting** | Basic webhook (Slack-compatible) for critical findings |
| 12 | **JSON/YAML Output** | Machine-readable output for CI/CD integration |

### 1.2 What is OUT of MVP

| Feature | Why Deferred | Target Phase |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| Web dashboard | CLI-first philosophy; dashboard adds weeks of frontend work | Phase 6 |
| OTEL trace ingestion | Requires ClickHouse infrastructure; MVP must be zero-dependency | Phase 3 |
| Tool reliability analytics (from live traffic) | Requires proxy mode or SDK instrumentation | Phase 3 |
| Cost attribution engine | Requires live traffic data from OTEL traces | Phase 3 |
| RCA Agent (Claude-powered) | Requires trace data + tool reliability data as inputs | Phase 5 |
| Continuous monitoring daemon | MVP is run-on-demand; daemon adds process management complexity | Phase 4 |
| Prometheus metrics endpoint | No server component in MVP | ~~Phase 3~~ ✅ COMPLETE (shipped 2026-03-21) |
| PagerDuty/OpsGenie integration | Webhook is sufficient for MVP alerting | Phase 4 |
| Multi-transport SSE/StreamableHTTP | MVP focuses on stdio (most common); SSE/HTTP added iteratively | Phase 1, Week 3 |
| MCP proxy mode | Complex transparent proxy; deferred to Phase 2+ | Phase 3 |
| PyPI packaging | Ship as `pip install` after Phase 1 is stable | Phase 1, Week 3 |

### 1.3 MVP Success Criteria

The MVP is "done" when all of the following are true:

| # | Criterion | How to Verify |
|---|-----------|---------------|
| 1 | `pip install langsight` installs the CLI | Run on a clean Python 3.11+ environment |
| 2 | `langsight inventory` discovers MCP servers from at least 2 config file locations | Test with `claude_desktop_config.json` and `.cursor/mcp.json` |
| 3 | `langsight health check --all` connects to stdio MCP servers, lists tools, reports health score | Test with at least 3 different MCP servers (Snowflake, filesystem, a custom server) |
| 4 | `langsight schema diff` shows schema changes between two runs | Modify a tool's output schema between runs, verify diff is shown |
| 5 | `langsight security scan --all` finds CVEs in MCP server dependencies | Test with a server that has a known vulnerable dependency |
| 6 | `langsight security scan` detects tool description injection patterns | Test with a tool description containing `"ignore previous instructions"` |
| 7 | `langsight security scan` flags MCP servers with no authentication | Test with an unauthenticated server |
| 8 | JSON output works for all commands (`--format json`) | Pipe output to `jq` and validate structure |
| 9 | Webhook alerting fires on critical security findings | Configure a Slack webhook, verify message arrives |
| 10 | All data persists in PostgreSQL across runs | Run health check twice, verify schema history exists |
| 11 | Total setup time under 60 seconds | Time the install-to-first-scan experience |
| 12 | Works on macOS and Linux (x86_64 and arm64) | Test on both platforms |

- [ ] `langsight security scan --all` produces grouped output: CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW
- [ ] `langsight security scan --format sarif` produces valid SARIF that GitHub Code Scanning accepts
- [ ] Security score reflects reality: a server with a critical CVE scores below 30
- [ ] `langsight report` combines health + security in a single output

### Pre-Production Security Hardening (Security Assessment 2026-03-18)

**Status**: IN PROGRESS — S.4, S.7, S.9, S.10 complete; S.1-S.3, S.5-S.6, S.8 remaining.

**Context**: A security review on 2026-03-18 identified two P0 blockers and two P1 gaps that prevent honest production claims. This phase must be completed before 0.2.0 can be called production-grade. See `PROGRESS.md` for the full assessment summary. A principal engineer audit on 2026-03-21 addressed S.4 (global rate limiting), S.7 (DB port binding), and added dashboard security headers + CORS tightening. A subsequent audit on 2026-03-21 added a CI type-check job for the dashboard and DualStorage protocol conformance tests.

| Task | ID | Description | Priority |
|------|----|-------------|----------|
| API key middleware on all API routes | S.1 | Add FastAPI dependency that validates `X-API-Key` header against a configurable key list. Wildcard CORS in `api/main.py` must be restricted to known origins. | P0 |
| RBAC — admin and viewer roles | S.2 | Admin: full access including triggering scans and ingesting spans. Viewer: read-only. Enforce at the router dependency level. | P0 |
| Dashboard real credential store or OIDC | S.3 | Replace hardcoded users in `dashboard/lib/auth.ts` with either a proper credential store or OIDC provider integration. Any-password-accepted logic must be removed. | P0 |
| ✅ Rate limiting on all endpoints | S.4 | Global `default_limits=["200/minute"]` via `SlowAPIMiddleware` on all API endpoints. All routers share a single `Limiter` instance from `src/langsight/api/rate_limit.py` (refactored 2026-03-21 — previously each router created separate instances, preventing per-route overrides). Per-route overrides: spans=2000/min, otlp=60/min, accept-invite=5/min, verify=10/min. **COMPLETE 2026-03-21** — goes beyond original scope (ingestion-only) to cover all endpoints. | P1 |
| Audit logging for security-sensitive actions | S.5 | Log (structured, to storage) all security scans triggered, auth failures, and config changes. Include actor, timestamp, source IP. | P1 |
| No default secrets in docker-compose | S.6 | Remove hardcoded Postgres password, ClickHouse default user, and dashboard secret from `docker-compose.yml`. Require explicit env var injection. Add `.env.example` with placeholder values only. | P1 |
| ✅ Close public DB ports in compose | S.7 | ClickHouse and Postgres ports bound to `127.0.0.1` instead of `0.0.0.0`. Databases are not reachable from external hosts. **COMPLETE 2026-03-21** | P1 |
| Schema migration strategy | S.8 | Implement Alembic for Postgres schema migrations. Document ClickHouse migration approach (versioned SQL scripts). Neither database schema should be managed by application startup DDL in production. | P1 |
| ✅ Threat model document | S.9 | Write `docs/06-threat-model.md` covering: trust boundaries, attack surface, deployment topology, data classification, and vulnerability disclosure policy. **COMPLETE 2026-03-19** — 10 threat scenarios, 8 known gaps, full deployment topology, vulnerability disclosure policy. | P1 |
| ✅ Readiness/liveness probe split | S.10 | Split `GET /api/status` into `/readiness` (can serve traffic) and `/liveness` (process is alive). Docker health check now uses `http://127.0.0.1:3002` (not `localhost`) to avoid IPv6 resolution issues on Alpine. **COMPLETE 2026-03-21** — dashboard health check fixed to use IPv4 address directly. | P1 |

**Acceptance criteria for this phase**:
- [ ] `POST /api/traces/spans` with no API key returns HTTP 401
- [ ] `docker-compose.yml` has no hardcoded secrets; `docker compose up` fails fast with a clear error if required env vars are absent
- [x] ClickHouse and Postgres ports are not bound to `0.0.0.0` in the default compose — **DONE 2026-03-21**: bound to `127.0.0.1`
- [ ] Dashboard login rejects invalid credentials
- [ ] `docs/06-threat-model.md` exists and covers all 6 trust boundary areas
- [ ] Alembic `alembic upgrade head` applies all Postgres schema without errors on a fresh database

### Phase 5: Deep Reliability Features (the Missing Killer Features)

**Status**: COMPLETE ✅ (2026-03-19) — all seven features shipped

**Goal**: Make LangSight the tool engineers actually reach for when debugging a failed agent run. Close the gap between "we have trace metadata" and "we can fully replay and diagnose what happened".

**Why this matters**: Currently LangSight captures *that* a tool was called and *whether it succeeded*, but not *what it was called with* or *what it returned*. Without payloads, session replay shows a skeleton, not a full picture. Every feature in this phase builds on payload capture.

### Phase 6: Project-Level RBAC (decided 2026-03-19)

**Status**: NOT STARTED

**Goal**: Introduce the Project as the top-level isolation boundary. All reliability data belongs to a project. Users hold project-level roles. Global admins see everything. Non-members receive HTTP 404 (not 403) to prevent project enumeration.

**Why this matters**: LangSight currently operates as a single flat namespace — every user sees every trace, SLO, and API key. Teams running multiple agents (e.g., "Customer Support Bot" vs "Internal HR Bot") need data isolation, independent API keys, and per-project access control before LangSight can be deployed in a shared environment.

---

#### Role Hierarchy

```
Global roles (on User model — existing):
  admin  → sees all projects, create/delete projects, manage all users
  viewer → sees only projects where they have explicit membership

Project-level roles (new — on ProjectMember):
  owner  → full control: rename project, invite members, delete project
  member → operational access: view traces, create SLOs, trigger scans, manage API keys
  viewer → read-only: view all data, no write operations
```

**Three access rules**:
1. Global admin → full access to every project regardless of membership
2. Project owner/member/viewer → access only to projects they are a member of
3. No membership → project is invisible (HTTP 404, prevents enumeration)

---

    api_key="lsk_...",
    project_id="customer-support",  # new — scopes all spans to this project
)
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] `LangSightClient(project_id="...")` populates `project_id` on every emitted `ToolCallSpan`
- [ ] `LangSightClient()` without `project_id` emits spans with `project_id=None` (backward compatible)
- [ ] `ToolCallSpan.project_id` is included in the JSON payload sent to `POST /api/traces/spans`

#### P6.6 — Dashboard: Project Switcher

| Task | Description | Files Affected | Status |
|------|-------------|----------------|--------|
| P6.6.1 | Fetch user's project list from `GET /api/projects` on app load; store active project in React context or Zustand | `dashboard/lib/store.ts` (new) or `dashboard/lib/context.tsx` | [ ] |
| P6.6.2 | Sidebar project switcher dropdown — shows active project name with chevron; opens list of user's projects + "Create project" link | `dashboard/components/sidebar.tsx` | [ ] |
| P6.6.3 | All dashboard API calls append `?project_id={activeProjectId}` when a project is selected | `dashboard/lib/api.ts` | [ ] |
| P6.6.4 | Active project persisted to `localStorage` per user; restored on next visit | `dashboard/lib/store.ts` | [ ] |
| P6.6.5 | Settings page: "Projects" tab — list user's projects, "Create project" form (name + slug), member list per project, invite by user ID, change role dropdown, remove member button | `dashboard/app/(dashboard)/settings/page.tsx` | [ ] |
| P6.6.6 | TypeScript types: `Project`, `ProjectMember`, `ProjectRole` added to `dashboard/lib/types.ts` | `dashboard/lib/types.ts` | [ ] |
| P6.6.7 | API functions: `listProjects()`, `createProject()`, `getProject()`, `listMembers()`, `addMember()`, `updateMemberRole()`, `removeMember()` added to `dashboard/lib/api.ts` | `dashboard/lib/api.ts` | [ ] |

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Sidebar shows active project name; clicking opens switcher with all user's projects
- [ ] Switching project updates all dashboard pages to show data scoped to new project
- [ ] Active project selection survives page reload (localStorage)
- [ ] Settings > Projects tab allows creating a project and inviting members
- [ ] Global admin can see all projects in the switcher regardless of membership

| P6.7.2 | Call `_bootstrap_default_project` inside the existing `_bootstrap_admin` flow after the admin user is created/confirmed | `src/langsight/api/main.py` | [ ] |
| P6.7.3 | Bootstrap creates: `Project(id=uuid4(), name="Default", slug="default", created_by=admin_id)` and `ProjectMember(project_id=..., user_id=admin_id, role=ProjectRole.OWNER)` | `src/langsight/api/main.py` | [ ] |
| P6.7.4 | Bootstrap is idempotent — if a project with `slug="default"` already exists, skip creation | `src/langsight/api/main.py` | [ ] |
| P6.7.5 | Unit test for bootstrap idempotency | `tests/unit/api/test_bootstrap.py` | [ ] |

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Fresh API startup creates "Default" project with the bootstrap admin as owner
- [ ] Second startup does not create a duplicate "Default" project
- [ ] Bootstrap admin can immediately use the dashboard scoped to the Default project without manual setup
- [ ] No environment variable is needed to enable bootstrap — it is automatic

### Phase 7: Model-Based Cost Tracking (decided 2026-03-19)

**Status**: NOT STARTED

**Goal**: Replace the flat $/call cost engine with a model-aware token-based pricing layer. Engineers will see actual LLM spend (input + output tokens × model price) alongside infrastructure tool-call costs, split clearly so the LLM bill and the MCP tool overhead are never conflated. A managed `model_pricing` table carries seed data for all major providers and is user-extensible for custom or self-hosted models.

**Why this matters**: The current cost engine assigns a flat cost-per-call to every tool invocation using `.langsight.yaml` rules. This works for MCP tool calls (which have no token dimension) but is wrong for LLM spans captured via OTLP — those spans carry `gen_ai.usage.input_tokens` and `gen_ai.usage.output_tokens` and should be priced against the model's published rate card, not a hardcoded flat fee. Without this, every LLM call is either $0 (no rule matched) or wildly over/under-counted.

**Cost calculation logic after this phase**:
```
For each span:
  if span.model_id is set AND (span.input_tokens > 0 OR span.output_tokens > 0):
    cost = (input_tokens / 1_000_000 × input_price) + (output_tokens / 1_000_000 × output_price)
    cost_type = "token_based"
  else:
    cost = apply CostRule glob match from .langsight.yaml (existing logic)
    cost_type = "call_based"
```

    provider              TEXT NOT NULL,             -- "anthropic" | "openai" | "google" | "meta" | "aws" | "custom"
    model_id              TEXT NOT NULL,             -- matches gen_ai.request.model attribute
    display_name          TEXT NOT NULL,             -- human-readable name
    input_per_1m_usd      REAL NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,  -- $ per 1M input tokens
    output_per_1m_usd     REAL NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,  -- $ per 1M output tokens
    cache_read_per_1m_usd REAL NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,  -- $ per 1M cached input tokens (Anthropic prompt caching)
    effective_from        TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,      -- when this price took effect
    effective_to          TIMESTAMPTZ,               -- NULL = currently active; set when superseded
    notes                 TEXT,                      -- e.g. "Public pricing as of 2026-03"
    is_custom             BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE  -- TRUE = user-added custom model
)
-- Unique constraint: (provider, model_id, effective_from) — supports price history

| P7.2.9 | Update `SpanNode` TypeScript interface in `dashboard/lib/types.ts` with `input_tokens`, `output_tokens`, `model_id` | `dashboard/lib/types.ts` | [ ] |

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] OTLP span with `gen_ai.usage.input_tokens=1000, gen_ai.usage.output_tokens=200, gen_ai.request.model=claude-sonnet-4-6` stores correctly in ClickHouse
- [ ] `get_session_trace()` returns `input_tokens`, `output_tokens`, `model_id` on every span row
- [ ] SDK `ToolCallSpan` can be constructed with `input_tokens=500, output_tokens=100, model_id="gpt-4o"`
- [ ] Spans without token data store `NULL` for `input_tokens`/`output_tokens` and `''` for `model_id` — no errors

#### P7.3 — Cost Engine: Token-Based Pricing for LLM Spans

**Goal**: Cost engine uses model pricing table for LLM spans; falls back to call-based CostRule for non-LLM tool spans. Response split into `llm_cost_usd` and `tool_cost_usd`.

| Task | Description | Files Affected | Status |
|------|-------------|----------------|--------|
| P7.3.1 | Add `ModelPricingLookup` helper class to `src/langsight/costs/engine.py` — constructor accepts `list[dict]` pricing rows; `cost_for(model_id, input_tokens, output_tokens) -> float` returns 0.0 for unknown models | `src/langsight/costs/engine.py` | [ ] |
| P7.3.2 | Extend `CostEntry` dataclass with `input_tokens: int`, `output_tokens: int`, `model_id: str \| None`, `cost_type: Literal["token_based", "call_based"]` | `src/langsight/costs/engine.py` | [ ] |
| P7.3.3 | Update `calculate_costs()` in engine — per span: if `model_id` non-empty AND (`input_tokens > 0` OR `output_tokens > 0`), use `ModelPricingLookup.cost_for()`; else use existing CostRule glob match | `src/langsight/costs/engine.py` | [ ] |
| P7.3.4 | Update `GET /api/costs/breakdown` to load model pricing rows from storage (`list_model_pricing()`) and pass to engine; add `project_id: str \| None` query param (scope via ClickHouse filter when provided) | `src/langsight/api/routers/costs.py` | [ ] |
| P7.3.5 | Add `llm_cost_usd: float` and `tool_cost_usd: float` to the breakdown response — sum of token-based costs vs sum of call-based costs respectively | `src/langsight/api/routers/costs.py` | [ ] |
| P7.3.6 | Update `GET /api/costs/by-agent` and `GET /api/costs/by-session` to also accept `project_id` query param | `src/langsight/api/routers/costs.py` | [ ] |
| P7.3.7 | Unit test: LLM span — 1000 input + 200 output tokens, `model_id=claude-sonnet-4-6` → `cost = (1000/1_000_000 × 3.0) + (200/1_000_000 × 15.0) = 0.003 + 0.003 = 0.006` | `tests/unit/test_cost_engine.py` | [ ] |
| P7.3.8 | Unit test: tool span (no tokens, no model_id) → falls back to CostRule; `cost_type = "call_based"` | `tests/unit/test_cost_engine.py` | [ ] |
| P7.3.9 | Unit test: `project_id=X` passed to breakdown endpoint → ClickHouse query includes `WHERE project_id = 'X'` | `tests/unit/api/test_costs_router.py` | [ ] |

**`ModelPricingLookup` contract**:
```python
class ModelPricingLookup:
    def __init__(self, pricing_rows: list[dict]) -> None:
        # index by model_id; active rows only (effective_to IS NULL)
        ...

    def cost_for(
        self,
        model_id: str,
        input_tokens: int,
        output_tokens: int,
    ) -> float:
        # Returns 0.0 if model_id not found (fail-open)
        ...
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] `claude-sonnet-4-6`, 1000 input + 200 output tokens → `$0.006` exact
- [ ] Unknown `model_id` → `$0.0` (no KeyError, no exception)
- [ ] Tool span with no token data → call-based CostRule applied; `cost_type = "call_based"`
- [ ] `GET /api/costs/breakdown` response includes `llm_cost_usd` and `tool_cost_usd` at top level
- [ ] `?project_id=X` scopes all three cost endpoints to that project's spans

#### P7.4 — API Endpoints for Model Pricing Management

**Goal**: Full CRUD API for model pricing so operators can add custom models and update prices when providers change their rates. Price updates create a new row with `effective_from=NOW()` and deactivate the old one — preserving audit history.

| Task | Description | Files Affected | Status |
|------|-------------|----------------|--------|
| P7.4.1 | Add `ModelPricingEntry` and `CreateModelPricingRequest` Pydantic response/request models to `api/routers/costs.py` | `src/langsight/api/routers/costs.py` | [ ] |
| P7.4.2 | `GET /api/costs/models` — list all model pricing entries (active and inactive); optional `?active_only=true` filter | `src/langsight/api/routers/costs.py` | [ ] |
| P7.4.3 | `POST /api/costs/models` — create a custom model pricing entry; `require_admin` dependency; sets `is_custom=True` | `src/langsight/api/routers/costs.py` | [ ] |
| P7.4.4 | `PATCH /api/costs/models/{id}` — update price: deactivates existing row (`effective_to=NOW()`), inserts new row with updated prices and `effective_from=NOW()`; `require_admin` dependency | `src/langsight/api/routers/costs.py` | [ ] |
| P7.4.5 | `DELETE /api/costs/models/{id}` — deactivate a pricing entry (`effective_to=NOW()`); `require_admin` dependency; HTTP 404 if id not found | `src/langsight/api/routers/costs.py` | [ ] |
| P7.4.6 | Unit tests for all four endpoints — list, create, patch (verify old row deactivated + new row created), delete (verify `effective_to` set) | `tests/unit/api/test_costs_router.py` | [ ] |

**Endpoints**:

| Method | Path | Role | Description |
|--------|------|------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/api/costs/models` | authenticated | List all model pricing entries |
| `POST` | `/api/costs/models` | admin | Add a custom model pricing entry |
| `PATCH` | `/api/costs/models/{id}` | admin | Update price (audit trail — deactivates old, inserts new) |
| `DELETE` | `/api/costs/models/{id}` | admin | Deactivate a pricing entry |

**Request/Response models**:
```python
class ModelPricingEntry(BaseModel):
    id: str
    provider: str
    model_id: str
    display_name: str
    input_per_1m_usd: float
    output_per_1m_usd: float
    cache_read_per_1m_usd: float
    effective_from: str       # ISO 8601
    effective_to: str | None  # None = currently active
    notes: str | None
    is_custom: bool

class CreateModelPricingRequest(BaseModel):
    provider: str
    model_id: str
    display_name: str
    input_per_1m_usd: float
    output_per_1m_usd: float
    cache_read_per_1m_usd: float = 0.0
    notes: str | None = None
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] `GET /api/costs/models` returns all 16+ pricing entries including seed data
- [ ] `POST /api/costs/models` with valid `CreateModelPricingRequest` creates entry with `is_custom=True`
- [ ] `PATCH /api/costs/models/{id}` creates a new row AND sets `effective_to` on the old row (two rows in DB after update)
- [ ] `DELETE /api/costs/models/{id}` sets `effective_to`, does not hard-delete
- [ ] Non-admin calling `POST`/`PATCH`/`DELETE` receives HTTP 403
- [ ] `DELETE` on unknown id returns HTTP 404

#### P7.5 — Dashboard: Model Pricing Table in Settings

**Goal**: Settings page shows the full model pricing table grouped by provider. Admins can edit prices and add custom models without touching the database directly.

| Task | Description | Files Affected | Status |
|------|-------------|----------------|--------|
| P7.5.1 | Add `ModelPricingEntry` TypeScript interface to `dashboard/lib/types.ts` | `dashboard/lib/types.ts` | [ ] |
| P7.5.2 | Add `listModelPricing()`, `createModelPricing(req)`, `updateModelPricing(id, updates)`, `deleteModelPricing(id)` to `dashboard/lib/api.ts` | `dashboard/lib/api.ts` | [ ] |
| P7.5.3 | Add `ModelPricingSection` component to `dashboard/app/(dashboard)/settings/page.tsx` — table with columns: Provider | Model | Input $/1M | Output $/1M | Effective From | Status | Actions | `dashboard/app/(dashboard)/settings/page.tsx` | [ ] |
| P7.5.4 | Group rows by provider (Anthropic / OpenAI / Google / Meta / AWS / Custom) with collapsible sections | `dashboard/app/(dashboard)/settings/page.tsx` | [ ] |
| P7.5.5 | Inline edit form per row — clicking "Edit" expands input fields for `input_per_1m_usd` and `output_per_1m_usd`; Save calls `PATCH /api/costs/models/{id}` | `dashboard/app/(dashboard)/settings/page.tsx` | [ ] |
| P7.5.6 | "Add custom model" button — opens a modal/drawer with `CreateModelPricingRequest` fields; Submit calls `POST /api/costs/models` | `dashboard/app/(dashboard)/settings/page.tsx` | [ ] |
| P7.5.7 | "Custom" badge on rows where `is_custom=true`; seed model rows show `is_custom=false` and the model_id field is read-only | `dashboard/app/(dashboard)/settings/page.tsx` | [ ] |
| P7.5.8 | Inactive rows (where `effective_to` is set) shown as greyed-out with "Inactive" badge; default hidden behind "Show history" toggle | `dashboard/app/(dashboard)/settings/page.tsx` | [ ] |

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Settings page loads model pricing table via `GET /api/costs/models`
- [ ] Rows grouped by provider with Anthropic expanded by default
- [ ] Admin can click Edit on a row, change a price, Save — table refreshes with new price
- [ ] "Add custom model" form submits and new row appears under "Custom" group
- [ ] Non-admin users see the table but Edit/Add/Delete actions are hidden

---

#### P7.6 — Dashboard: Costs Page Token Breakdown

**Goal**: Costs page gains a "By Model" table showing token counts and model-attributed costs, plus summary cards that split LLM spend from tool-call spend.

| Task | Description | Files Affected | Status |
|------|-------------|----------------|--------|
| P7.6.1 | Add `llm_cost_usd`, `tool_cost_usd`, `by_model` fields to the costs breakdown TypeScript types in `dashboard/lib/types.ts` | `dashboard/lib/types.ts` | [ ] |
| P7.6.2 | Update `getCostBreakdown()` in `dashboard/lib/api.ts` to pass `project_id` query param when active project is set | `dashboard/lib/api.ts` | [ ] |
| P7.6.3 | Add "LLM Tokens Cost" and "Tool Calls Cost" summary cards to the costs page header row (alongside existing "Total Spend") | `dashboard/app/(dashboard)/costs/page.tsx` | [ ] |
| P7.6.4 | Add "Top Model" summary card — model with highest cost in the selected window | `dashboard/app/(dashboard)/costs/page.tsx` | [ ] |
| P7.6.5 | Add "By Model" breakdown table to costs page: columns — Model | Provider | Input Tokens | Output Tokens | Total Cost | % of Spend | `dashboard/app/(dashboard)/costs/page.tsx` | [ ] |
| P7.6.6 | "By Model" table only renders when at least one span with `model_id` exists; otherwise shows "No LLM spans recorded yet" placeholder | `dashboard/app/(dashboard)/costs/page.tsx` | [ ] |

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Costs page shows "LLM Tokens Cost" and "Tool Calls Cost" as separate summary cards
- [ ] "By Model" table appears and shows correct token counts and costs when LLM spans exist
- [ ] "Top Model" card shows the highest-cost model by name
- [ ] "By Model" table absent (placeholder shown) when no `model_id` spans exist
- [ ] All costs page data respects active project scope via `?project_id=`

**Phase 7 overall acceptance gate**:
- [ ] LLM span with 1000 input + 200 output tokens for `claude-sonnet-4-6` → cost = `$0.006` exact
- [ ] Tool span (no tokens) → call-based CostRule applied; `cost_type = "call_based"`
- [ ] `GET /api/costs/breakdown` returns `llm_cost_usd` and `tool_cost_usd` split
- [ ] `GET /api/costs/models` returns all 16 seed entries
- [ ] Admin can add a custom model via `POST /api/costs/models` and it immediately appears in the engine
- [ ] Price update via `PATCH` produces two DB rows (audit trail); old row has `effective_to` set

## Phase 9: Production Auth — JWT Sessions ✅ COMPLETE

**Status**: COMPLETE — 2026-03-19
**Priority**: P0 — blocks SaaS launch. Anyone who knows the API URL can read all data.

### Problem

NextAuth handles login against `/api/users/verify` and creates a client-side session, but the dashboard **never sends that session to the FastAPI backend**. Every API call from the dashboard is unauthenticated. The "login" is cosmetic — it doesn't protect the API.

### Root cause chain

```
User logs in via NextAuth (dashboard)
  → NextAuth session stored in browser cookie (JWT, signed with AUTH_SECRET)
  → Dashboard makes API calls to FastAPI via Next.js proxy routes (/api/*)
  → Proxy routes do NOT forward the session token to FastAPI
  → FastAPI sees no auth header → auth_disabled=True → returns all data
```

### Solution: Trusted proxy headers (SHIPPED — changed from original plan)

**Original plan**: Forward NextAuth JWT as `Authorization: Bearer` to FastAPI.
**Shipped approach** (changed from original): Next.js proxy reads the NextAuth session server-side and injects `X-User-Id` + `X-User-Role` headers. FastAPI trusts those headers only from localhost (`127.0.0.1` / `::1`). No JWT verification needed in FastAPI — the trust boundary is the network.

```
Browser → Next.js proxy (reads session, injects X-User-* headers) → FastAPI (trusts only from localhost)
```

This is simpler than JWT verification: no shared secret required, no token parsing in FastAPI, and the security model is explicit — external clients cannot spoof X-User-* headers because FastAPI rejects them from non-localhost origins.

#### Task P9.1 — Next.js catch-all proxy route ✅

`dashboard/app/api/proxy/[...path]/route.ts` — catch-all proxy reads the NextAuth session server-side and forwards `X-User-Id` + `X-User-Role` headers to FastAPI. All dashboard API calls go through `/api/proxy/*`. Unauthenticated requests return 401 before reaching FastAPI.

(changed from original: file path is `app/api/proxy/[...path]/route.ts`, not `app/api/[...proxy]/route.ts`; headers are X-User-Id/X-User-Role, not Authorization: Bearer)

#### Task P9.2 — FastAPI trusts proxy headers from localhost ✅

`src/langsight/api/dependencies.py` implements:
- `_is_proxy_request()` — returns True only when request originates from `127.0.0.1` or `::1`
- `_get_session_user()` — extracts `user_id` and `role` from X-User-Id / X-User-Role headers
- `verify_api_key()` — accepts session headers as auth (no API key needed for dashboard users); falls back to X-API-Key for SDK/CLI
- `require_admin()` — checks session role for write operations
- `get_active_project_id()` — new dependency for project isolation

(changed from original: no Bearer token / JWT verification path; two auth paths are session headers from proxy and X-API-Key from SDK/CLI)

#### Task P9.3 — Shared secret (changed from original) ✅

`LANGSIGHT_AUTH_SECRET` is shared between Next.js (NextAuth session signing) and FastAPI. FastAPI does not use it for JWT verification (no JWT path shipped) — it is used for any future HMAC request signing. Both services must have the same value.

#### Task P9.4 — Update `dashboard/lib/auth.ts` ✅

Session callbacks expose `userId` and `userRole` so the proxy can forward them as X-User-Id and X-User-Role.

#### Task P9.5 — Update all dashboard API calls to go through proxy ✅

`dashboard/lib/api.ts`: `BASE` changed from `/api` to `/api/proxy`. All dashboard requests now route through the authenticated proxy. `NEXT_PUBLIC_LANGSIGHT_API_KEY` is no longer required in the browser — auth is server-side only.

#### Task P9.6 — Rate limit the login endpoint

```python
# src/langsight/api/routers/users.py
from slowapi import Limiter

@public_router.post("/users/verify")
@limiter.limit("10/minute")
async def verify_user(...):
    ...
```

#### Task P9.7 — Security headers middleware

```python
# src/langsight/api/main.py
from starlette.middleware.base import BaseHTTPMiddleware

class SecurityHeadersMiddleware(BaseHTTPMiddleware):
    async def dispatch(self, request, call_next):
        response = await call_next(request)
        response.headers["X-Content-Type-Options"] = "nosniff"
        response.headers["X-Frame-Options"] = "DENY"
        response.headers["Strict-Transport-Security"] = "max-age=31536000"
        return response
```

### Acceptance criteria

- [x] Logged-out browser cannot access `/api/health/servers` — gets 401
- [x] Logged-in admin sees all data
- [x] Logged-in viewer cannot call DELETE or POST endpoints
- [x] API key still works for SDK/CLI (backward compatible)
- [x] Auth disabled mode still works for local dev (no env vars set)
- [x] Login endpoint returns 429 after 10 failed attempts per minute

### Files affected (shipped 2026-03-19)

```

## Phase 10: Multi-Tenancy Isolation ✅ COMPLETE

**Status**: COMPLETE — 2026-03-19
**Priority**: P0 — without this, all users see all data regardless of project.

### Problem

`project_id` is stored on `ToolCallSpan` objects and on `AgentSLO` but the ClickHouse queries that power the dashboard **do not filter by `project_id`**. Every user sees every trace from every project, regardless of which project they're in.

### Root cause

```python
# storage/clickhouse.py — current (no project filter)
async def get_agent_sessions(self, hours: int = 24) -> list[dict]:
    query = """
        SELECT session_id, agent_name, ...
        FROM mcp_tool_calls
        WHERE started_at >= now() - INTERVAL {hours} HOUR
        GROUP BY session_id, agent_name
    """

# Should be:
async def get_agent_sessions(self, hours: int = 24, project_id: str | None = None) -> list[dict]:
    where = "started_at >= now() - INTERVAL {hours} HOUR"
    if project_id:
        where += " AND project_id = {project_id}"
    ...
```

### Solution: `project_id` filter propagated from request → storage

#### Task P10.1 — Add `project_id` param to all ClickHouse queries

Every query in `storage/clickhouse.py` that reads from `mcp_tool_calls` must accept an optional `project_id` filter:

| Method | Add filter |
|---|---|
| `get_agent_sessions()` | `AND project_id = {project_id}` |
| `get_session_trace()` | `AND project_id = {project_id}` |
| `get_cost_call_counts()` | `AND project_id = {project_id}` |
| `get_baseline_stats()` | `AND project_id = {project_id}` |
| `get_tool_reliability()` | `AND project_id = {project_id}` |
| `compare_sessions()` | verify both sessions belong to same project |

#### Task P10.2 — Extract `project_id` from request in API routers

Every router that reads ClickHouse data must resolve the active project for the caller:

```python
# src/langsight/api/dependencies.py

async def get_active_project_id(
    request: Request,
    project_id: str | None = Query(default=None),
    storage: StorageBackend = Depends(get_storage),
    current_user: CurrentUser = Depends(verify_session),
) -> str | None:
    """
    Returns the project_id to filter by, or None (all projects for global admin).
    Verifies the caller is a member of the requested project.
    """
    if not project_id:
        return None  # admin sees all, or no filter

    # Verify membership
    members = await storage.list_members(project_id)
    is_member = any(m.user_id == current_user.id for m in members)
    is_global_admin = current_user.role == "admin"

    if not is_member and not is_global_admin:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Project not found")

    return project_id
```

#### Task P10.3 — Pass `project_id` through to storage in every affected router

```python
# Example: agents.py router
@router.get("/agents/sessions")
async def get_sessions(
    hours: int = 24,
    project_id: str | None = Depends(get_active_project_id),
    storage: StorageBackend = Depends(get_storage),
):
    return await storage.get_agent_sessions(hours=hours, project_id=project_id)
```

Affected routers: `agents.py`, `costs.py`, `reliability.py`, `slos.py`, `traces.py`

#### Task P10.4 — Dashboard sends `project_id` on every request

The `useProject()` context already holds `activeProject`. Ensure every SWR key includes it:

```typescript
// dashboard/lib/project-context.tsx — already exists
// Every SWR key must include projectParam:

const { activeProject } = useProject();
const projectParam = activeProject ? `&project_id=${activeProject.id}` : "";

useSWR(`/api/agents/sessions?hours=${hours}${projectParam}`, fetcher);
useSWR(`/api/costs/breakdown?hours=${hours}${projectParam}`, getCostsBreakdown);
```

Check every `useSWR` call in every dashboard page — add `projectParam` to the key and the fetch URL.

#### Task P10.5 — Postgres backends

Both backends have `agent_slos` with `project_id`. Apply same filter pattern for consistency.

#### Task P10.6 — Tests

```python
# tests/unit/storage/test_clickhouse_project_filter.py
async def test_get_sessions_filters_by_project():
    # Insert spans for project A and project B
    # Query with project_id=A → only A's spans returned
    # Query with project_id=B → only B's spans returned
    # Query with project_id=None → all spans returned (admin view)
```

### Acceptance criteria

- [x] User in project A cannot see sessions from project B
- [x] Global admin with no `project_id` filter sees all data
- [x] Global admin with `project_id=A` filter sees only project A
- [x] Switching project in sidebar switches all dashboard data
- [ ] `compare_sessions` returns 404 if sessions are from different projects (deferred — not yet enforced)
- [x] All affected ClickHouse queries tested with and without project filter

### Phase 8: Dashboard + Polish (originally Phase 7 — superseded)

**Status**: PARTIALLY COMPLETE — marketing website (`website/`) and product dashboard (`dashboard/`) were shipped post-0.1.0 as part of Phase 4 scope expansion. The items below represent the originally planned phase that has been partially absorbed into earlier phases.

**Note**: This section is retained for traceability. The dashboard core pages, cost attribution UI, and agents page were all shipped in Phase 4 (2026-03-18). Remaining items from the original plan (Playwright E2E tests, Helm chart, CONTRIBUTING.md) are tracked in the release checklist.

## 2B. Revised Phase Structure (decided 2026-03-17)

### Why we changed the plan

After studying Langfuse's adoption model, we identified a critical gap: engineers will not configure an OTEL collector before they have seen the tool produce value. The original plan (Phase 3: OTEL ingestion) required Docker infrastructure before any integration was possible.

**Insight**: Langfuse grew because `from langfuse.openai import OpenAI` was two lines. We need the same for LangSight. Engineers should be able to add LangSight instrumentation to an existing agent in under 5 minutes before ever touching a config file.

**Secondary insight**: LibreChat's Langfuse integration is not OTEL-based — it uses env vars (`LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY`, etc.) that LibreChat reads natively. A LangSight plugin for LibreChat follows the same pattern (`LANGSIGHT_URL`) and is ~50 lines of Node.js.

**Decision**: SDK wrapper and framework integrations ship in Phase 2, OTEL and ClickHouse infrastructure moves to Phase 3. (decided 2026-03-17)

---

### Phase 1 — COMPLETE (95%)

**Completed**: 2026-03-17

**Remaining (Phase 1 tail)**:
- [ ] `langsight costs` command stub (placeholder, full implementation Phase 3)
- [ ] PyPI packaging and `pip install langsight` verification

---

### Phase 2 — In Progress (50%)

**Goal**: Make LangSight a 2-line integration for any Python agent developer. SDK wrapper ships before OTEL. Framework adapters and LibreChat plugin ship alongside the SDK.

**Timeline estimate**: 4-6 weeks from Phase 1 completion

#### 2.1 LangSight SDK Wrapper

**Objective**: `LangSightClient` + `wrap(mcp_client)` — engineers add two lines to existing agent code and get full MCP call instrumentation.

```python
# Target developer experience
from langsight.sdk import LangSightClient

client = LangSightClient(url="http://localhost:8000")
mcp_client = wrap(mcp_client, client)  # all tool calls now recorded
```

| Task | Description | Est. Hours |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| SDK.1 | `src/langsight/sdk/__init__.py`: `LangSightClient(url, api_key)` — async HTTP client wrapper | 4h |
| SDK.2 | `LangSightClient.record_tool_call(span)`: POST to `/api/traces/spans`, fire-and-forget | 4h |
| SDK.3 | `wrap(mcp_client, langsight_client)`: proxy that intercepts `call_tool()`, measures latency, records success/error | 6h |
| SDK.4 | Context manager support: `async with LangSightClient(...) as client:` | 2h |
| SDK.5 | `ToolCallSpan` Pydantic model: server_name, tool_name, input_hash, success, latency_ms, error, trace_id | 3h |
| SDK.6 | Fail-open: SDK errors never propagate to the wrapped MCP client — reliability instrumentation must not break the agent | 3h |
| SDK.7 | `LANGSIGHT_URL` env var support: `LangSightClient()` with no args reads from env | 2h |
| SDK.8 | Tests: wrap a mock MCP client, verify spans are sent; verify fail-open on HTTP errors | 4h |

**Deliverables**:
- `src/langsight/sdk/` package with `LangSightClient`, `wrap()`, `ToolCallSpan`
- SDK docs with quickstart example

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] `wrap(mcp_client, client)` transparently proxies all `call_tool()` calls
- [ ] A tool call that succeeds produces a span with `success=True`, measured `latency_ms`
- [ ] A tool call that raises an exception produces a span with `success=False`, `error=str(e)`, and the exception re-raises to the caller
- [ ] HTTP errors from LangSight API do not surface to the agent (fail-open)
- [ ] `LangSightClient(url="http://localhost:8000")` and `LangSightClient()` (env var) both work

---

#### 2.2 Framework Integrations

**Objective**: Native integration adapters for CrewAI, Pydantic AI, LangChain/Langflow/LangGraph/LangServe, OpenAI Agents SDK, Anthropic/Claude, and LibreChat so engineers do not need to manually call `wrap()`.

| Task | Description | Est. Hours | Status |
|------|-------------|-----------|--------|
| FW.1 | `src/langsight/integrations/crewai.py`: `LangSightCrewAICallback` — hooks into CrewAI's tool call lifecycle | 6h | DONE |
| FW.2 | `src/langsight/integrations/pydantic_ai.py`: middleware that wraps Pydantic AI's `Tool` objects | 6h | DONE |
| FW.3 | `src/langsight/integrations/langchain.py`: `LangSightLangChainCallback` — covers LangChain, Langflow, LangGraph, LangServe | 6h | DONE |
| FW.4 | Common `IntegrationBase`: shared span-recording logic used by all adapters | 3h | DONE |
| FW.5 | Integration tests: each adapter tested with a minimal real framework agent (mocked MCP server) | 6h | DONE |
| FW.6 | Framework detection: `langsight.integrations.auto_configure()` detects installed frameworks and registers adapters | 3h | |
| FW.7 | `src/langsight/integrations/openai_agents.py`: `LangSightOpenAIHooks` (RunHooks protocol) + `langsight_openai_tool` decorator | 6h | **DONE 2026-03-21** |
| FW.8 | `src/langsight/integrations/anthropic_sdk.py`: `AnthropicToolTracer` + `LangSightClaudeAgentHooks` + `langsight_anthropic_tool` decorator | 6h | **DONE 2026-03-21** |
| FW.9 | `src/langsight/integrations/langgraph.py`: `LangSightLangGraphCallback` — graph-aware node tracing, extends LangChain callback | 6h | **DONE 2026-03-21** |

**Integration pattern (CrewAI example)**:

```python
from langsight.integrations.crewai import LangSightCrewAICallback

crew = Crew(
    agents=[...],
    tasks=[...],
    callbacks=[LangSightCrewAICallback(langsight_url="http://localhost:8000")]
)
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [x] CrewAI adapter records tool calls without requiring `wrap()` on the MCP client
- [x] Pydantic AI adapter records spans for all `Tool` invocations
- [x] LangChain callback adapter records spans for LangChain, Langflow, LangGraph, and LangServe agents
- [x] All adapters respect fail-open: agent execution continues if LangSight is unreachable
- [ ] Trace IDs propagate correctly across nested tool calls
- [x] OpenAI Agents SDK adapter (`LangSightOpenAIHooks`) traces tool calls via `RunHooks` protocol — **DONE 2026-03-21**
- [x] Anthropic/Claude adapter (`AnthropicToolTracer`, `LangSightClaudeAgentHooks`) traces `tool_use` blocks — **DONE 2026-03-21**
- [x] LangGraph dedicated adapter (`LangSightLangGraphCallback`) tracks graph node names + conditional routing — **DONE 2026-03-21**

---

#### 2.3 LibreChat Plugin

**Objective**: 50-line Node.js plugin that hooks into LibreChat's MCP call path using the `LANGSIGHT_URL` env var — same pattern LibreChat already uses for Langfuse.

**Why this approach** (decided 2026-03-17): LibreChat does not emit OTEL natively. It has Langfuse built in via `LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY` env vars. Building a native plugin following the same pattern is the path of least resistance for LibreChat users, and it requires no changes to LibreChat core.

| Task | Description | Est. Hours |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| LC.1 | `integrations/librechat/langsight-plugin.js`: intercept LibreChat's MCP call path | 6h |
| LC.2 | Read `LANGSIGHT_URL` + `LANGSIGHT_API_KEY` from env, POST spans to `/api/traces/spans` | 3h |
| LC.3 | Handle connection errors silently (fail-open, same as Langfuse plugin) | 2h |
| LC.4 | `integrations/librechat/README.md`: installation instructions (copy file, set env vars) | 2h |
| LC.5 | Test with a local LibreChat instance (integration test, manual verification) | 3h |

**Installation pattern**:

```bash
# In LibreChat .env
LANGSIGHT_URL=http://localhost:8000
LANGSIGHT_API_KEY=ls_key_...

# Copy plugin to LibreChat plugins directory
cp integrations/librechat/langsight-plugin.js /path/to/librechat/plugins/
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Plugin file is self-contained — no npm dependencies beyond what LibreChat already has
- [ ] MCP tool calls in LibreChat appear as spans in LangSight API
- [ ] Plugin fails open: LibreChat continues working when LangSight is unreachable
- [ ] Installation requires only two env vars and copying one file

---

#### 2.4 `langsight investigate` Command

**Objective**: AI-powered root cause analysis using Claude Agent SDK. Queries health history, recent alerts, and schema changes to attribute agent failures.

| Task | Description | Est. Hours |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| INV.1 | `src/langsight/cli/investigate.py`: Click command — `langsight investigate "description"` | 3h |
| INV.2 | Evidence collector: query health history, alerts, schema changes for relevant time window | 6h |
| INV.3 | Claude Agent SDK integration: feed evidence as context, structured output for findings | 6h |
| INV.4 | Tool functions exposed to Claude: `query_health_history`, `query_recent_alerts`, `query_schema_changes` | 4h |
| INV.5 | Cost controls: max 50K tokens per investigation, timeout 120s, max 20 tool calls | 3h |
| INV.6 | Rule-based fallback: when `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is not set, use deterministic heuristics | 4h |
| INV.7 | Tests: mocked Claude responses, verify evidence collection, verify fallback | 4h |

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] `langsight investigate "agent returned wrong data"` produces a structured finding with confidence level and recommendations
- [ ] Investigation completes within 120 seconds for typical failure scenarios
- [ ] Fallback mode (no API key) produces useful output based on health history alone
- [ ] Cost per investigation stays under $0.50 for typical scenarios

---

#### 2.5 API: Span Ingestion Endpoint

**Objective**: Add `POST /api/traces/spans` to the FastAPI REST API so the SDK and framework adapters have a target to write to.

| Task | Description | Est. Hours |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| API.1 | `src/langsight/api/routers/traces.py`: `POST /api/traces/spans` — accept `ToolCallSpan` batch | 4h |
| API.2 | Write spans to storage backend (PostgreSQL for metadata, ClickHouse for traces) | 3h |
| API.3 | `GET /api/traces/spans`: query spans by server, tool, time range, success status | 3h |
| API.4 | Tests: verify ingestion, verify query filtering | 3h |

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] `POST /api/traces/spans` accepts a batch of up to 1000 spans
- [ ] Spans are queryable within 5 seconds of ingestion (PostgreSQL/ClickHouse)
- [ ] `GET /api/traces/spans?tool=my_tool&since=2026-03-17T00:00:00Z` returns correct results

---

#### 2.6 Agent Sessions and Multi-Agent Tracing (added 2026-03-17)

**Objective**: Answer the primary new product question — "What did my agent call, in what order, how long did each tool take, which ones failed, what did it cost?" — including full multi-agent call trees.

**Why here**: This is now the primary value proposition of the product (see product pivot 2026-03-17). The `parent_span_id` mechanism is a model change and a new set of API endpoints. It can be built on top of the existing SDK and `ToolCallSpan` infrastructure from 2.1.

| Task | Description | Est. Hours |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| AG.1 | Add `parent_span_id: str \| None` and `agent_name: str \| None` and `span_type: Literal["tool_call", "agent", "handoff"]` to `ToolCallSpan` model in `src/langsight/sdk/models.py` | 2h |
| AG.2 | Add `span_type` values to storage schemas (PostgreSQL migration + ClickHouse DDL) | 2h |
| AG.3 | `GET /api/agents/sessions` — list all agent sessions with aggregated cost, call count, failure count, start/end time | 4h |
| AG.4 | `GET /api/agents/sessions/{session_id}` — full ordered span tree for one session; reconstruct hierarchy from `parent_span_id` | 4h |
| AG.5 | `langsight sessions` CLI command — Rich table of recent sessions with cost and health | 4h |
| AG.6 | `langsight sessions --id sess-abc123` — full trace view for one session showing multi-agent tree | 4h |
| AG.7 | Agent span recording: lifecycle spans for agent start/end events (not just tool calls) | 3h |
| AG.8 | Handoff spans: explicit span type for agent-to-agent delegation; records parent agent, child agent, reason | 3h |
| AG.9 | SDK: expose `parent_span_id` and `span_type` in `wrap()` so orchestrators can pass context to sub-agents | 3h |
| AG.10 | SDK ergonomics for session propagation | 4h |
| AG.11 | ClickHouse `mv_agent_sessions` materialized view: pre-aggregate session-level metrics from span data (Phase 3 prereq) | 3h |
| AG.12 | Tests: session grouping, parent_span_id tree reconstruction, handoff spans | 4h |

**`parent_span_id` design**: Uses the same model as OpenTelemetry distributed tracing. Every `ToolCallSpan` optionally carries a `parent_span_id` that references another span's `span_id`. Tree reconstruction is a recursive query — no separate tree storage needed. When Agent A triggers Agent B, Agent A emits a handoff span. Agent B's tool call spans set `parent_span_id` to that handoff span's `span_id`.

**CLI output (`langsight sessions`)**:

```
Agent Sessions                               last 24 hours
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Session          Agent              Duration   Tools   Failures   Cost
sess-f2a9b1      support-agent      1,482ms       5          1   $0.023
sess-d4c7e8      data-analyst       4,210ms      12          0   $0.089
sess-a0b3f5      orchestrator        890ms        3          0   $0.012
```

**CLI output (`langsight sessions --id sess-f2a9b1`)**:

```
Session: sess-f2a9b1
Agent:   orchestrator → research → action
Started: 2026-03-17T14:02:31Z
Total:   1,482ms | 3 agents | 5 tool calls | 1 failure | $0.023

```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] `GET /api/agents/sessions` returns sessions grouped by session_id with aggregated metrics
- [ ] `GET /api/agents/sessions/{session_id}` reconstructs the full span tree via `parent_span_id`
- [ ] `langsight sessions` renders a Rich table with cost and failure count per session
- [ ] `langsight sessions --id <id>` renders the multi-agent tree with tool names, latency, and status
- [ ] Agent B's spans correctly reference Agent A's handoff span via `parent_span_id`
- [ ] Session propagation ergonomics improved beyond explicit `wrap(..., session_id=..., trace_id=..., parent_span_id=...)` wiring

---

### Phase 3 — Backlog

**Goal**: OTEL ingestion pipeline, ClickHouse backend, tool reliability engine, cost attribution. This is the production-scale infrastructure tier — comes after the SDK proves adoption.

**Why OTEL comes here, not Phase 2**: Enterprise teams adopting LangSight via the SDK will ask for OTEL integration once they trust the tool. Starting with OTEL-first would have required Docker infrastructure as a prerequisite, blocking adoption for the majority of users who use Python agents directly.

#### 3.1 OTEL Ingestion

| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| OTEL.1 | `POST /api/traces/otlp`: accept standard OTLP protobuf spans |
| OTEL.2 | OTEL Collector (contrib) config: receive on 4317/4318, export to LangSight API |
| OTEL.3 | ClickHouse backend: `StorageBackend` implementation using `clickhouse-connect` |
| OTEL.4 | ClickHouse schema: `mcp_tool_calls` table (MergeTree, partitioned by day) |
| OTEL.5 | Materialized views: `tool_reliability_hourly`, `tool_error_taxonomy`, `mv_agent_sessions` (pre-aggregates session-level metrics from spans) |
| OTEL.6 | TTL policy: tool calls 90 days, OTEL traces 30 days |
| OTEL.7 | Docker Compose (root-level): PostgreSQL + ClickHouse + OTEL Collector + LangSight API |

**ClickHouse schema (target)**:

```sql
CREATE TABLE mcp_tool_calls (
    recorded_at     DateTime,
    server_name     LowCardinality(String),
    tool_name       LowCardinality(String),
    trace_id        String,
    span_id         String,
    parent_span_id  Nullable(String),   -- added 2026-03-17: enables multi-agent tree reconstruction
    session_id      Nullable(String),   -- groups spans into agent sessions
    agent_name      LowCardinality(Nullable(String)),
    span_type       LowCardinality(String),  -- 'tool_call' | 'agent' | 'handoff'
    success         Bool,
    latency_ms      Float32,
    error           Nullable(String),
    input_hash      String,
    framework       LowCardinality(String)
) ENGINE = MergeTree()
PARTITION BY toYYYYMMDD(recorded_at)
ORDER BY (server_name, tool_name, recorded_at)
TTL recorded_at + INTERVAL 90 DAY;
```

#### 3.2 Tool Reliability Engine

| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| REL.1 | ClickHouse materialized view: success rate, error rate, p95 latency per tool per hour |
| REL.2 | Failure taxonomy: classify errors into timeout, auth_error, schema_mismatch, rate_limited, unknown |
| REL.3 | Baseline learning: 7-day rolling baseline per tool, alert on deviation |
| REL.4 | `GET /api/tools/reliability`: return per-tool metrics over configurable window |
| REL.5 | Tool quality score v2: incorporate live traffic data (error rate, p95) into scoring |

#### 3.3 Cost Attribution

| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| COST.1 | Cost rules config in `.langsight.yaml`: per-call, per-token, per-byte pricing per tool |
| COST.2 | Cost calculation engine: apply rules to `mcp_tool_calls` in ClickHouse |
| COST.3 | `langsight costs` CLI command: weekly breakdown by tool, anomaly highlights |
| COST.4 | Budget alerts: configurable spend limits per tool/team, fire at 80% and 100% |
| COST.5 | `GET /api/costs/breakdown`: return cost aggregation by tool, period |

#### 3.4 Root-Level Docker Compose

The current test-mcps/docker-compose.yml is for development only. Phase 3 ships a production-ready root-level docker-compose.yml:

| Service | Image | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| `langsight-api` | langsight/api | FastAPI REST API |
| `langsight-worker` | langsight/worker | Health checks, security scans, alerts |
| `postgres` | postgres:16-alpine | Metadata, configs, alerts |
| `clickhouse` | clickhouse/clickhouse-server | Time-series tool call data |
| `otel-collector` | otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib | OTLP ingestion |

**Acceptance Criteria for Phase 3**:
- [ ] `docker compose up` starts full stack in under 60 seconds
- [ ] OTEL span sent via `otel-cli` appears in ClickHouse within 5 seconds
- [ ] `langsight costs --period 7d` shows real cost data from ClickHouse
- [ ] Tool reliability queries return in <500ms for 1M spans in ClickHouse
- [ ] OTEL ingestion handles >10,000 spans/second sustained

#### 4.3 Product Dashboard (app.langsight.dev) — COMPLETE ✅

**Status**: Built at `dashboard/`. Core authenticated dashboard is live behind the NextAuth + proxy architecture. Recent UX consolidation (2026-03-20) moved topology exploration under Agents and session debugging into the dedicated `/sessions/[id]` route.

**Pages built**: Overview (`(dashboard)/page.tsx`), Agents (`agents/page.tsx`), Health (`health/page.tsx`), Sessions (`sessions/page.tsx` + `sessions/[id]/page.tsx`), Security (`security/page.tsx`), Costs (`costs/page.tsx`), Settings (`settings/page.tsx`).

**Tech**: Next.js 15 with App Router, shadcn/ui component library, recharts for time-series charts.

| Page | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Overview | Agent/workflow summary first, with tool infrastructure as a drill-down |
| Agents | Per-agent activity, failures, cost, and touched tools/MCPs |
| Tools & MCPs | Tool backend health, schema status, and MCP infrastructure drill-down |
| Security Posture | OWASP compliance, CVE list, poisoning scan timeline |
| Tool Reliability | Ranked tool list, error rates, latency trends (requires Phase 3 OTEL data) |
| Cost Attribution | Live cost breakdown by tool, agent, and session from traced calls |
| Alert Management | View/acknowledge/configure alerts |

**Tech choices**:
- Next.js 15 with App Router
- shadcn/ui component library
- recharts for time-series charts
- Polls REST API (5s health, 30s metrics) + SSE live feed (`GET /api/live/events`) for real-time span and health events (shipped 2026-03-21)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Overview page loads in <2 seconds with data from 50 tools
- [ ] Real-time metric changes appear on dashboard within 10 seconds
- [ ] Dashboard is responsive at 1920px, 1440px, 1024px
- [ ] Alert acknowledgement in dashboard is reflected in CLI within 5 seconds

## 6. Verification Plan

### 6.1 Per-Phase Smoke Tests

#### Phase 1 Smoke Test

```bash
# 1. Install
pip install langsight

# 2. Discover servers
langsight inventory
# EXPECT: Table showing at least 1 MCP server from local config

# 3. Health check
langsight health check --all
# EXPECT: Health score for each server (0-100), tool list per server

# 4. Schema snapshot
langsight health check --all  # First run creates snapshots
# ... modify a tool schema ...
langsight schema diff
# EXPECT: Shows the schema change with breaking/non-breaking classification

# 5. JSON output
langsight health check --all --format json | python -m json.tool
# EXPECT: Valid JSON with server health data

# 6. Webhook alert
# Configure webhook in langsight.yaml, then run with a down server:
langsight health check --all
# EXPECT: Webhook fires with critical finding for unreachable server
```

#### Phase 2 Smoke Test

```bash
# 1. Security scan
langsight security scan --all
# EXPECT: Findings grouped by severity (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)

# 2. CVE detection
# Create a test server with a known vulnerable dependency
langsight security scan --server test-vulnerable
# EXPECT: CVE-XXXX-XXXXX found with CVSS score and fix version

# 3. Poisoning detection
# Create a test server with a malicious tool description
langsight security scan --server test-poisoned
# EXPECT: CRITICAL finding for tool description injection

# 4. SARIF output
langsight security scan --all --format sarif > results.sarif
# EXPECT: Valid SARIF file accepted by GitHub Code Scanning

# 5. Combined report
langsight report --all
# EXPECT: Combined health + security report with overall scores
```

#### Phase 3 Smoke Test

```bash
# 1. Start infrastructure
docker compose up -d

# 2. Send synthetic traces
python tests/fixtures/send_synthetic_traces.py
# EXPECT: Traces appear in ClickHouse

# 3. Reliability metrics
langsight reliability
# EXPECT: Tool reliability table with success rates, latency, error rates

# 4. Cost tracking
langsight costs --period 1h
# EXPECT: Cost breakdown by tool using configured pricing rules

# 5. Cost anomaly
# Send traces with artificially high call volume for one tool
langsight costs --anomalies
# EXPECT: Anomaly detected for the high-volume tool
```

#### Phase 4 Smoke Test

```bash
# 1. Configure alert
# Add threshold alert in langsight-alerts.yaml (error rate > 5%)

# 2. Start monitor
langsight monitor start

# 3. Trigger degradation
# Stop or slow down an MCP server

# 4. Verify alert
# EXPECT: Slack message arrives within 2 * check_interval
# EXPECT: langsight alerts list shows FIRING alert

# 5. Resolve
# Restart the MCP server

# 6. Verify resolution
# EXPECT: Alert transitions to RESOLVED
# EXPECT: Slack message confirms resolution
```

#### Phase 5 Smoke Test

```bash
# 1. Create a known failure scenario
# Configure an MCP server to timeout on a specific tool

# 2. Generate traces showing the failure
python tests/fixtures/send_failure_traces.py

# 3. Investigate
langsight investigate --tool crm.get_customer --since 1h
# EXPECT: Narrative RCA identifying the timeout
# EXPECT: Confidence score > 80%
# EXPECT: Blast radius listing affected agents
# EXPECT: Actionable remediation suggestions

# 4. Verify fallback
# Unset ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
langsight investigate --tool crm.get_customer --since 1h
# EXPECT: Rule-based RCA still produces useful output (less detailed)
```

#### Phase 6 Smoke Test

```bash
# 1. Start full stack
docker compose up -d

# 2. Seed data
python tests/fixtures/seed_dashboard_data.py

# 3. Open dashboard
open http://localhost:3000

# 4. Verify pages
# Overview: Fleet health score, active alerts, degraded tools
# Health: Server list with scores, drill-down to server detail
# Security: Findings by severity, OWASP compliance
# Reliability: Tool ranking, trend charts
# Costs: Cost breakdown, anomaly highlights
# Alerts: Active alerts, acknowledge from UI
# Settings: Server configuration

# 5. Real-time updates
# Change a tool's health while watching the dashboard
# EXPECT: Update appears within 5 seconds
```

### 6.2 End-to-End Test Scenario

This scenario exercises the full system end-to-end, simulating a realistic production incident.

```
SCENARIO: Tool Degradation -> Detection -> Alert -> Investigation -> Resolution

SETUP:
  - 5 MCP servers running (3 stdio, 2 SSE)
  - LangSight monitor running with 30s check interval
  - OTEL Collector receiving traces
  - Alert rules configured: error rate > 5% for 2 minutes -> CRITICAL

STEPS:

  1. [T+0s] Inject latency into mcp-snowflake (add 3s delay to all responses)

  2. [T+30s] LangSight health check detects latency regression
     VERIFY: Health score for mcp-snowflake drops
     VERIFY: Latency anomaly recorded in PostgreSQL

  3. [T+60s] Agent traces show increased error rates (some calls timeout)
     VERIFY: ClickHouse contains spans with status=DEADLINE_EXCEEDED

  4. [T+90s] Reliability engine detects error rate > 5%
     VERIFY: langsight reliability shows mcp-snowflake error rate > 5%

  5. [T+120s] Alert rule fires (error rate > 5% for 2 minutes)
     VERIFY: Alert in FIRING state
     VERIFY: Slack notification received
     VERIFY: Alert not duplicated (dedup working)

  6. [T+150s] Auto-investigation triggers (if configured)
