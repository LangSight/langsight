## [Unreleased]

### Added (2026-03-21 — Prometheus metrics + SSE live event feed)

- **Prometheus `/metrics` endpoint** — `src/langsight/api/metrics.py`: `GET /metrics` returns all LangSight metrics in Prometheus text exposition format, no authentication required. Metrics exported: `langsight_http_requests_total` (counter, method/path/status), `langsight_http_request_duration_seconds` (histogram, method/path), `langsight_spans_ingested_total` (counter), `langsight_active_sse_connections` (gauge), `langsight_health_checks_total` (counter, server/status). `PrometheusMiddleware` instruments all API requests with path normalization (collapses UUIDs to `{id}`) to keep cardinality bounded. Skips `/metrics`, `/api/liveness`, `/api/readiness`.
- **SSE live event feed** — `src/langsight/api/broadcast.py` + `src/langsight/api/routers/live.py`: `GET /api/live/events` streams Server-Sent Events to connected dashboard clients. Events: `span:new` (fired on span ingestion in `traces.py`), `health:check` (fired on health check completion). `SSEBroadcaster` is an in-memory asyncio pub/sub — max 200 concurrent clients, 50-event buffer per client (oldest dropped when full), 15-second keepalive heartbeats. The `/api/live/events` endpoint requires authentication (same as all other API routes). `ACTIVE_SSE` gauge tracks connected clients in Prometheus.
- **New dependency**: `prometheus-client>=0.21` added to `pyproject.toml`.
- **Tests**: 20 new tests (11 for Prometheus metrics, 9 for SSE broadcaster). Total: 957 tests passing.

### Added (2026-03-21 — SDK integrations: OpenAI Agents, Anthropic/Claude, LangGraph)

- **SDK: OpenAI Agents integration** — `src/langsight/integrations/openai_agents.py`: `LangSightOpenAIHooks` class implementing the `RunHooks` protocol; hooks into `on_tool_start`/`on_tool_end` to trace every tool call automatically. Also provides `langsight_openai_tool` decorator for tracing individual tool functions.
- **SDK: Anthropic/Claude integration** — `src/langsight/integrations/anthropic_sdk.py`: `AnthropicToolTracer` traces `tool_use` content blocks from Anthropic SDK message responses; `LangSightClaudeAgentHooks` provides lifecycle hooks for the Claude Agent SDK agent loop; `langsight_anthropic_tool` decorator for individual tool handlers. Works with both the `anthropic` package and `claude_agent_sdk`.
- **SDK: LangGraph integration** — `src/langsight/integrations/langgraph.py`: `LangSightLangGraphCallback` extends the LangChain callback with graph-aware context — tracks which graph node is executing, groups spans at the graph level, and surfaces conditional routing. Works with both sync `invoke()` and async `ainvoke()`.
- **Docs-site: 3 new integration pages** — `docs-site/sdk/integrations/openai-agents.mdx`, `docs-site/sdk/integrations/anthropic.mdx`, `docs-site/sdk/integrations/langgraph.mdx` added to Mintlify site; `mint.json` navigation updated with all three pages in "SDK & Integrations" group.
- **Integration count now 9**: MCP (SDK wrap), LangChain, LangGraph, CrewAI, Pydantic AI, OpenAI Agents, Anthropic/Claude, OTEL, LibreChat.

### Fixed (2026-03-21 — rate limiter: single instance + latency_ms auto-compute)

- **Rate limiter: single global instance** — created `src/langsight/api/rate_limit.py` exporting a single `limiter = Limiter(key_func=get_remote_address, default_limits=["200/minute"])`. All routers (`main.py`, `traces.py`, `users.py`) now import from this module instead of creating separate `Limiter` instances. Per-route overrides now work correctly: traces=2000/min, otlp=60/min, accept-invite=5/min, verify=10/min.
- **`latency_ms` auto-compute** — `ToolCallSpan.latency_ms` changed from required to optional (`float | None = None`). A `model_validator(mode="after")` auto-computes it from `ended_at - started_at` when omitted. SDK users and OTLP ingestion no longer need to calculate latency manually.

### Fixed (2026-03-21 — principal engineer audit: security, correctness, scale, Docker)

- **Security: AWS credential leak** — removed `test-mcps/s3-mcp/.env` volume mount from the production API service in `docker-compose.yml`; AWS credentials are no longer exposed to the API container
- **Security: DB port binding** — ClickHouse and Postgres ports in `docker-compose.yml` now bind to `127.0.0.1` instead of `0.0.0.0`; databases are no longer reachable from external hosts
- **Security: demo credentials gated** — login page (`dashboard/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx`) now only displays demo credentials when `NODE_ENV !== "production"`; production deployments no longer leak default passwords in the UI
- **Security: CORS default tightened** — `LANGSIGHT_CORS_ORIGINS` default changed from `"*"` (wildcard) to `"http://localhost:3003"` in `config.py`; production deployments must explicitly configure allowed origins
- **Security: global rate limiting** — added `SlowAPIMiddleware` with `default_limits=["200/minute"]` on all API endpoints; previously only ingestion routes were rate-limited
- **Security: dashboard security headers** — Next.js dashboard now sets `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`, `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`, and `Permissions-Policy` headers on all responses
- **Security: PII masking in audit logs** — `_mask_email()` in the API now produces `"a***@example.com"` when logging user actions; raw emails no longer appear in audit log entries
- **Correctness: DualStorage.accept_invite** — `DualStorage` was missing delegation to `self._meta.accept_invite()`; calling `accept_invite()` through the dual backend raised `AttributeError`; now correctly routes to `PostgresBackend`
- **Correctness: delete metadata** — `delete_agent_metadata` and `delete_server_metadata` in `postgres.py` now check `!= "DELETE 0"` instead of `.endswith("1")`; previously failed silently when deleting rows with multi-digit affected counts
- **Correctness: session compare 404** — `GET /api/agents/sessions/compare` no longer returns 404 for spans that lack a `project_id` (pre-tagging data); the compare endpoint now handles `None` project_id gracefully
- **Correctness: typo fix** — `getServerHistoty` renamed to `getServerHistory` in `dashboard/lib/api.ts` and all consuming pages
- **Performance: health page lazy loading** — removed O(N) health history preload on `/health` page mount; history is now fetched lazily when a server row is expanded, reducing initial page load time proportional to server count
- **Performance: agents page SWR staggering** — reduced sessions fetch limit from 500 to 100 on the agents page and staggered SWR refresh intervals across data fetchers to avoid concurrent API thundering herd
- **Performance: executemany batch** — `upsert_server_tools` in `postgres.py` replaced N sequential `execute()` calls with a single `executemany()` batch, reducing DB round trips from O(N) to O(1)
- **Cleanup: top-level imports** — moved `import json`, `import uuid`, and `from datetime import datetime` out of function bodies to module top-level in `postgres.py`
- **Docker: dashboard health check** — changed health check URL from `http://localhost:3002` to `http://127.0.0.1:3002` in both `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`; Alpine Linux `wget` resolves `localhost` to `::1` (IPv6) first while the server listens on IPv4 only, causing false unhealthy status
- **Docker: dashboard hostname binding** — added `HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0` to the dashboard service in `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`; Next.js standalone mode was binding to `127.0.0.1` inside the container, making the dashboard unreachable from the Docker network
- **Correctness: list_projects role resolution** — `list_projects()` now resolves the caller's role per project; `your_role` was previously always `null` in the response

### Added (2026-03-21 — CI + test improvements)

- **CI: Dashboard type check job** — new GitHub Actions job runs `tsc --noEmit` on the Next.js dashboard; TypeScript errors in dashboard code now block CI
- **Test: DualStorage protocol conformance** — `TestProtocolConformance` class in `test_dual.py` introspects the `StorageBackend` protocol and verifies `DualStorage` explicitly implements every method; prevents silent `__getattr__` fallback hiding missing delegation
- **Test: accept_invite routing** — new test verifies `accept_invite` calls are correctly routed to the metadata backend in `DualStorage`

### Added (2026-03-20 — session detail graph toolbar, MCP Servers catalog, agents catalog, SDK tool-schema capture)

- Session detail lineage graph: graph toolbar with search bar (highlights/dims nodes), zoom slider (25-250%), Expand All / Collapse All buttons, and Failures toggle that isolates the error chain
- Session detail lineage graph: minimap (150×90px, bottom-right) showing full graph with draggable viewport rectangle
- Session detail lineage graph: timeline bar above graph — one colored segment per `tool_call` span (green/red/yellow); click to select the node in the graph
- Session detail lineage graph: `PayloadSlideout` component — full-width slide-over panel with JSON line numbers, copy button, word wrap toggle, tab selector (Input/Output/Prompt/Completion), Esc to close
- Session detail lineage graph: per-tool edge expansion — circular `+` button on edges with call count (e.g. `5×`) splits the server node into per-tool sub-nodes
- Session detail lineage graph: "View in Agent/Server Catalog →" link in node detail panels navigates to `/agents` or `/servers` with the node pre-selected
- Keyboard shortcuts on session detail graph: `/` focus search, `f` fit view, `e` toggle error highlight, `+`/`-` zoom, `Esc` deselect
- Agents catalog: 3-state adaptive layout — State 1 (full-width sortable table with Needs Attention banner), State 2 (280px grouped sidebar + detail panel), State 3 (56px icon-rail + full-width topology graph when Topology tab is active)
- Agents catalog: editable metadata fields (description, owner, tags, status, runbook URL) on the About tab; writes to `PUT /api/agents/metadata/{name}` on blur
- MCP Servers catalog at `/servers`: same 3-state adaptive layout as Agents; "MCP Servers" added to sidebar primary nav between Agents and Costs
- MCP Servers catalog detail panel — 4 tabs: About (editable metadata), Tools (declared tools with reliability metrics), Health (uptime%, trend chart, last 15 checks), Consumers (agents that call this server from lineage data)
- PostgreSQL tables `server_metadata` and `server_tools` added to DDL; both idempotent on schema init
- New API endpoints: `GET /api/servers/metadata`, `PUT /api/servers/metadata/{name}`, `GET /api/servers/{name}/tools`, `PUT /api/servers/{name}/tools`
- SDK `MCPClientProxy.list_tools()` intercepted — tool names, descriptions, and input schemas fire-and-forget posted to `PUT /api/servers/{server_name}/tools` on every call; fail-open (MCP client returns normally if backend is unreachable)
- `dashboard/components/payload-slideout.tsx` — new reusable component
- `dashboard/components/session-timeline.tsx` — new reusable component
- `dashboard/components/agent-topology.tsx` — new component wrapping `LineageGraph` scoped to a single agent's edges
- `dashboard/components/editable-field.tsx` — new reusable `EditableText`, `EditableTextarea`, `EditableTags`, `EditableUrl` components
- `dashboard/app/(dashboard)/servers/page.tsx` — new page at `/servers`

### Added (2026-03-20 — session detail + agent topology UX)

- `dashboard/app/(dashboard)/sessions/[id]/page.tsx` — dedicated full-page session debugger. Session rows now drill into `/sessions/{id}` instead of relying on the older inline workflow interaction model.
- Session detail page now has two working surfaces:
  - `Details` tab — session timeline, interactive lineage graph, and a 70/30 split detail panel for selected agents, servers, edges, and individual tool calls
  - `Trace` tab — nested span tree with inline payload/error expansion for tool and LLM spans
- Session compare flow moved onto the session detail page: compare target is picked from recent sessions, then rendered inline as a side-by-side diff table.
- Agents page gained topology exploration:
  - per-agent topology tab using the shared lineage graph
  - global topology modal for fleet-wide agent/server relationships

### Changed (2026-03-20 — lineage navigation + rendering)

- `/lineage` dashboard route now redirects to `/agents`; lineage exploration is consolidated under the Agents experience rather than a separate standalone page.
- `dashboard/components/lineage-graph.tsx` replaced the React Flow-based implementation with a raw SVG + `dagre` renderer shared by session and agent topology views.
- The lineage graph now supports expand/collapse for multi-caller servers and per-tool/per-call breakdowns directly inside the shared renderer.

### Removed (2026-03-20 — React Flow dependency)

- `@xyflow/react` removed from the dashboard package after the SVG lineage renderer shipped.
- `dashboard/package-lock.json` and `dashboard/package.json` cleaned up to drop the unused React Flow dependency chain.

### Breaking (2026-03-19 — SQLite removed)

- `mode: sqlite` in `.langsight.yaml` now raises `ConfigError` with migration guidance. Valid modes: `postgres` | `clickhouse` | `dual`. Migrate by switching to `mode: dual` and running `docker compose up -d`.
- `storage/sqlite.py` deleted. `SQLiteBackend` class no longer exists. Remove any direct imports.
- `open_storage()` factory no longer returns `SQLiteBackend`. Code that checked `isinstance(storage, SQLiteBackend)` will break.

### Added (2026-03-19 — Dual-storage architecture)

- `src/langsight/storage/dual.py` — `DualStorage` class: routes metadata ops to `PostgresBackend` and analytics ops to `ClickHouseBackend`. Satisfies the full `StorageBackend` protocol transparently; callers need no changes.
- `src/langsight/storage/factory.py` — `open_storage()` now dispatches `mode="dual"` to `DualStorage(metadata=PostgresBackend, analytics=ClickHouseBackend)`. Default `StorageConfig.mode` changed from `"sqlite"` to `"dual"`.
- `docker-compose.yml`: Postgres port `5432` and ClickHouse ports `8123`/`9000` now exposed to host (required for integration tests). `LANGSIGHT_STORAGE_MODE: dual` set as API container default. Required env vars enforced via `${VAR:?error}` syntax — compose refuses to start with missing secrets.
- `.env.example` — new file: documents all required and optional env vars with instructions.

### Added (2026-03-19 — Integration test infrastructure)

- `tests/conftest.py`: `require_postgres`, `require_clickhouse`, `require_all_services` session-scoped fixtures; auto-skip tests when Docker service is not reachable.
- `tests/integration/storage/test_postgres_storage.py` — full Postgres storage integration tests against real DB with uuid-based server names.
- Regression tests migrated from `SQLiteBackend` to `PostgresBackend`.

### Fixed (2026-03-19 — SDK auth header, CRITICAL)

- SDK was sending `Authorization: Bearer <key>`; API only read `X-API-Key`. Traces were silently dropped in any authenticated deployment (no error, just missing data).
- Fixed: `_read_api_key()` helper in `src/langsight/api/dependencies.py` reads `X-API-Key` first, then `Authorization: Bearer` as fallback. SDK now sends `X-API-Key`. Both forms accepted permanently for backward compatibility.

### Fixed (2026-03-19 — Docker proxy trust model, CRITICAL)

- `_TRUSTED_PROXY_IPS` was hardcoded to `{127.0.0.1, ::1}` — broken in Docker where the Next.js dashboard container has a `172.x.x.x` source IP, not loopback.
- Fixed: `parse_trusted_proxy_networks(cidrs_str)` in `dependencies.py` parses `LANGSIGHT_TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS` env var into `ipaddress.ip_network` objects stored on `app.state.trusted_proxy_networks` at startup. `_is_proxy_request()` checks the client IP against this CIDR list.
- Docker Compose default: `LANGSIGHT_TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS=127.0.0.1/32,::1/128,172.16.0.0/12,10.0.0.0/8`.

### Added (2026-03-19 — Alert config + audit log persistence)

- `alert_config` table in Postgres — singleton upsert row storing Slack webhook URL and per-alert-type enable flags. Previously stored in `app.state` (lost on API restart).
- `audit_logs` table in Postgres — append-only auth/RBAC event log. Previously an in-memory ring buffer (last 50 events, lost on restart). `append_audit()` now schedules an async DB write via `asyncio.create_task` — never blocks the request path.

### Changed (2026-03-19 — RBAC hardened)

- `POST /api/auth/api-keys`, `GET /api/auth/api-keys`, `DELETE /api/auth/api-keys/{id}` — now require admin role via `require_admin()` dependency.
- `POST /api/slos`, `DELETE /api/slos/{slo_id}` — now require admin role.
- `list_projects` — handles session-user path (X-User-Id headers) correctly; previously fell through to env-var key check.
- `get_active_project_id` and `get_project_access` — both check DB keys (not just env keys) for auth-disabled logic to prevent false "auth disabled" state when only DB keys exist.

### Added (2026-03-19 — Dashboard: accept-invite, NavProgress, loading skeleton)

- `/accept-invite` page — password + confirm password fields; calls `POST /api/accept-invite` (public Next.js API route, no session required); on success redirects to `/login`. Middleware updated to allow `/accept-invite` through unauthenticated.
- `NavProgress` component — thin indigo bar at top of dashboard; animates on sidebar link click, completes on route change.
- `dashboard/app/(dashboard)/loading.tsx` — Next.js App Router loading skeleton shown instantly during navigation; eliminates blank flash.
- Sidebar route prefetch — all sidebar routes prefetched on component mount for instant navigation.
- `health/page.tsx` — fixed `useState` → `useEffect` for HistoryPanel data fetch (was causing SSR hydration mismatch).
- Settings page — URL hash persistence on load; no flicker on refresh; section state driven by `window.location.hash`.

### Added (2026-03-19 — Settings redesign + Notifications + Audit Logs)

- Settings page: left-nav + content panel layout — 8 grouped sections replacing the previous single-scroll page (General, API Keys, Model Pricing, Members, Projects, Notifications, Audit Logs, Instance)
- Settings → General: Debug Information section showing instance URL and current version for SDK quick setup
- Settings → API Keys: `.env` snippet with `LANGSIGHT_API_KEY` and `LANGSIGHT_API_URL` for instant SDK instrumentation
- Settings → Notifications: Slack webhook URL field with inline test button; per-alert-type toggle switches for `mcp_down`, `mcp_recovered`, `agent_failure`, `slo_breached`, `anomaly_critical`, `security_critical`
- Settings → Audit Logs: table of last 50 auth/RBAC events; columns: timestamp, actor, action, resource, result. Initially backed by in-memory ring buffer; subsequently migrated to `audit_logs` Postgres table (see persistence fix above).
- `GET /api/alerts/config` — read current Slack webhook URL and per-type alert preferences
- `POST /api/alerts/config` — save Slack webhook URL and alert type preferences
- `POST /api/alerts/test` — send a test Slack Block Kit message to the configured webhook
- `GET /api/audit/logs` — list recent audit log events with `limit` and `offset` query params
- `AlertType.AGENT_FAILURE` — fires when an agent session has `failed_calls > 0`
- `AlertType.SLO_BREACHED` — fires when the SLO evaluator returns a breached status
- `AlertType.ANOMALY_DETECTED` — fires when z-score crosses the critical threshold
- `AlertType.SECURITY_FINDING` — fires on a CVE or OWASP critical finding

### Changed (2026-03-19 — Settings redesign + Notifications + Audit Logs)

- Settings page no longer uses a single scrolling layout — each of the 8 sections is isolated behind a left-nav click (changed from original: was single long scroll, now left-nav + content panel)
- Danger Zone pattern applied to destructive actions in Settings (consistent with GitHub/Vercel conventions)

### Added (2026-03-19 — Phase 9: Production Auth + Phase 10: Multi-Tenancy)

- `dashboard/app/api/proxy/[...path]/route.ts` — catch-all Next.js proxy route; reads NextAuth session server-side and injects `X-User-Id` + `X-User-Role` headers before forwarding to FastAPI; all dashboard API calls now go through `/api/proxy/*`; unauthenticated requests return 401 before reaching FastAPI
- `get_active_project_id` FastAPI dependency (`src/langsight/api/dependencies.py`) — verifies project membership before returning `project_id` filter; non-members receive 404 (no enumeration); global admin with no `project_id` query param bypasses filter and sees all data
- `SecurityHeadersMiddleware` in `src/langsight/api/main.py` — adds `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`, `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`, and `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000` (HTTPS only) to every API response
- `_is_proxy_request()` and `_get_session_user()` helpers in `src/langsight/api/dependencies.py` — trust `X-User-Id` / `X-User-Role` headers only when request originates from `127.0.0.1` or `::1`
- `require_admin()` dependency — checks session role for dashboard write operations

### Changed (2026-03-19 — Phase 9: Production Auth + Phase 10: Multi-Tenancy)

- `dashboard/lib/api.ts`: `BASE` changed from `/api` to `/api/proxy` — all dashboard requests are now authenticated via the NextAuth session proxy; `NEXT_PUBLIC_LANGSIGHT_API_KEY` is no longer required in the browser
- `dashboard/lib/auth.ts`: session callbacks now expose `userId` and `userRole` so the proxy can forward them as `X-User-Id` / `X-User-Role`
- `src/langsight/api/dependencies.py`: `verify_api_key()` now accepts session headers as auth — no API key required for dashboard users going through the proxy
- ClickHouse `get_cost_call_counts()` and `get_session_trace()` now accept optional `project_id` parameter; filter applied as `WHERE project_id = {project_id}` at DB level (no Python post-filter)
- `src/langsight/api/routers/agents.py`: `list_sessions` and `get_session` use `get_active_project_id` dependency — sessions are project-scoped
- `src/langsight/api/routers/costs.py`: `get_costs_breakdown` uses `get_active_project_id` dependency — replaces Python post-filter with DB-level isolation
- Dashboard pages (Overview, Sessions, Agents, Costs): all `useProject()` hook consumers now include `project_id` in SWR cache keys and fetch URLs when a project is active

### Security (2026-03-19 — Phase 9: Production Auth + Phase 10: Multi-Tenancy)

- `/api/users/verify` rate limited to 10 requests/minute per IP via `slowapi` — prevents brute-force against the login endpoint
- `X-User-Id` / `X-User-Role` headers trusted only from localhost proxy (`127.0.0.1` / `::1`) — external clients cannot spoof session identity

### Added (2026-03-19 — S.9 Threat Model)
- S.9: `docs/06-threat-model.md` — comprehensive threat model covering 5 trust boundaries, full attack surface table for all API endpoints and the OTEL Collector, data classification table with PII risk guidance, 10 threat scenarios (T-01 through T-10) each with attack path / impact / mitigations / residual risk, recommended production deployment topology with firewall rules, 8 documented known gaps (G-01 through G-08) with severity and mitigation notes, and a vulnerability disclosure policy with response time commitments
- S.9: `docs/04-implementation-plan.md` updated — S.9 marked complete (2026-03-19); Security Hardening progress updated to 10%

### Added (2026-03-19 — P5.7 Playground Replay)
- P5.7: Playground Replay — re-execute any session's tool calls against live MCP servers using stored `input_args`; replay stored as new session and auto-compared with original in the compare drawer
- P5.7: `POST /api/agents/sessions/{id}/replay` endpoint — configurable `timeout_per_call` (default 10s) and `total_timeout` (default 60s) parameters; returns `ReplayResponse` with `replay_session_id`
- P5.7: `replay_of: str | None` field on `ToolCallSpan` and `replay_of String DEFAULT ''` column on `mcp_tool_calls` ClickHouse table — links each replay span to its original span_id
- P5.7: `ReplayEngine` in `src/langsight/replay/engine.py` — filters to `tool_call` spans with `input_json` present, re-executes each via stored `input_args`, supports stdio (StdioServerParameters) and SSE/StreamableHTTP transports, fail-open per span (errors recorded as ERROR status spans, replay continues)
- P5.7: Replay button in trace drawer header — one click to replay and auto-open compare drawer diff between original and replay session; shows spinner and "Replaying..." while in flight; inline error message on failure

### Added (2026-03-19 — P5.6 Side-by-side session comparison)
- P5.6: Side-by-side session comparison — select two sessions (A/B) in the Workflows page and click Compare to see a diff table aligned by tool call order; diverged spans (status change or >=20% latency delta) highlighted in yellow
- P5.6: `GET /api/agents/sessions/compare?a=&b=` endpoint — returns aligned diff with `matched`/`diverged`/`only_a`/`only_b` entries and summary counts (`SessionComparison` response model)
- P5.6: `compare_sessions(session_a, session_b)` method on `ClickHouseBackend` — fetches both traces concurrently via `asyncio.gather`, aligns spans by `(server_name, tool_name)` call order, computes per-entry status
- P5.6: `_diff_spans()` helper — produces diff entries; `diverged` = status changed OR latency delta >= 20%; `only_a`/`only_b` for unmatched spans
- P5.6: `DiffEntry` and `SessionComparison` TypeScript interfaces added to `dashboard/lib/types.ts`
- P5.6: `compareSessions(a, b)` function added to `dashboard/lib/api.ts` — calls `GET /api/agents/sessions/compare`
- P5.6: `CompareDrawer` and `DiffRow` components in sessions page — colour-coded diff table (matched=green, diverged=yellow, only_a/only_b=blue/purple); latency delta column; first session row click selects A (blue), second click selects B (purple), Compare button appears when both are selected

### Added (2026-03-19 — P5.5 Agent SLO Tracking)
- P5.5: Agent SLO Tracking — define `success_rate` and `latency_p99` SLOs per agent; CRUD API at `/api/slos`; `SLOEvaluator` queries session data to compute current vs target; status is `ok`, `breached`, or `no_data`
- P5.5: `agent_slos` table added to SQLite and PostgreSQL backends; all four CRUD methods (`create_slo`, `list_slos`, `get_slo`, `delete_slo`) implemented on `StorageBackend` protocol and both backends
- P5.5: `SLOMetric` StrEnum (`success_rate`, `latency_p99`), `AgentSLO` Pydantic model, and `SLOEvaluation` Pydantic model added to `src/langsight/models.py`
- P5.5: `SLOEvaluator` class in `src/langsight/reliability/engine.py` — `success_rate` computed as `(clean_sessions / total_sessions) * 100`; `latency_p99` uses `max(duration_ms)` as a conservative proxy (true p99 requires raw span data)
- P5.5: `GET /api/slos/status` — evaluate all SLOs against current session data; `GET /api/slos` — list SLO definitions; `POST /api/slos` — create SLO; `DELETE /api/slos/{slo_id}` — delete SLO
- P5.5: Dashboard Overview "Agent SLOs" panel — shows per-SLO current value vs target with coloured status dot (`ok`=green, `breached`=red, `no_data`=grey); polls `/api/slos/status` every 60s via SWR; panel only renders when at least one SLO is defined
- P5.5: `SLOStatus` TypeScript interface added to `dashboard/lib/types.ts`; `getSLOStatus()`, `listSLOs()`, `deleteSLO()` functions added to `dashboard/lib/api.ts`

### Added (2026-03-19 — P5.4 Statistical anomaly detection)
- P5.4: Statistical anomaly detection — `AnomalyDetector` in `src/langsight/reliability/engine.py` computes z-score per tool against a 7-day ClickHouse baseline; fires `warning` anomaly when |z| >= 2 and `critical` when |z| >= 3 for both `error_rate` and `avg_latency_ms` metrics
- P5.4: `get_baseline_stats(baseline_hours=168)` method on `ClickHouseBackend` — queries `mv_tool_reliability` using `stddevPop()` and `avg()`; requires >= 3 sample hours to return a row, avoiding noisy baselines
- P5.4: `AnomalyResult` dataclass — `server_name`, `tool_name`, `metric`, `current_value`, `baseline_mean`, `baseline_stddev`, `z_score`, `severity`, `sample_hours`
- P5.4: Minimum stddev guards — `_MIN_STDDEV_ERROR_RATE = 0.01` (1%) and `_MIN_STDDEV_LATENCY_MS = 10.0` ms prevent false positives on perfectly stable tools
- P5.4: `GET /api/reliability/anomalies?current_hours=1&baseline_hours=168&z_threshold=2.0` endpoint — configurable detection window and sensitivity
- P5.4: `GET /api/reliability/tools?hours=24&server_name=...` endpoint — per-tool reliability metrics
- P5.4: `dashboard/lib/types.ts` — new `AnomalyResult` TypeScript interface
- P5.4: `dashboard/lib/api.ts` — new `getAnomalies(currentHours, zThreshold)` function calling `GET /api/reliability/anomalies`
- P5.4: Dashboard Overview "Anomalies Detected" metric card — live anomaly count with critical/warning breakdown, colour-coded severity, polls every 60s via SWR (replaces static "Tool Alerts" card)

### Added (2026-03-19 — P5.3 LLM reasoning capture)
- P5.3: LLM reasoning capture — OTLP spans carrying `gen_ai.prompt`/`gen_ai.completion` (or `llm.prompts`/`llm.completions`) attributes are now extracted and stored as `span_type="agent"` spans with `llm_input`/`llm_output` fields; model name extracted from `gen_ai.request.model`/`llm.model_name` and written to `tool_name`
- P5.3: `llm_input: str | None` and `llm_output: str | None` added to `ToolCallSpan` in `src/langsight/sdk/models.py`; `ToolCallSpan.record()` accepts and passes through both fields
- P5.3: ClickHouse `mcp_tool_calls` DDL extended with `llm_input Nullable(String)` and `llm_output Nullable(String)`; `_SPAN_COLUMNS`, `_span_row()`, and `get_session_trace()` updated
- P5.3: `SpanNode` API response model (`api/routers/agents.py`) includes `llm_input` and `llm_output` fields
- P5.3: `SpanNode` TypeScript interface (`dashboard/lib/types.ts`) updated with `llm_input: string | null` and `llm_output: string | null`
- P5.3: Sessions page (`dashboard/app/(dashboard)/sessions/page.tsx`) detects LLM spans (`span_type="agent"` with `llm_input`/`llm_output`) and shows "Prompt" / "Completion" labels in the detail panel instead of generic "Input" / "Output"
- P5.3: OTLP attribute parser (`api/routers/traces.py`) now handles `intValue`, `doubleValue`, and `boolValue` in addition to `stringValue`

### Added (2026-03-19 — P5.2 session replay payload visibility)
- P5.2: Session replay payload visibility — clicking any span row in the trace tree now expands an inline panel showing formatted input arguments and output result; error details shown for failed spans with no output (requires P5.1 payload capture)
- P5.2: `SpanNode` API response model (`api/routers/agents.py`) now includes `input_json: str | None` and `output_json: str | None` fields, passed through from `get_session_trace()`
- P5.2: `SpanNode` TypeScript interface (`dashboard/lib/types.ts`) updated with `input_json: string | null` and `output_json: string | null`

### Added (2026-03-18 — P5.1 payload capture)
- P5.1: Input/output payload capture — `ToolCallSpan` now records tool call arguments (`input_args: dict | None`) and return values (`output_result: str | None`); stored in ClickHouse `mcp_tool_calls` as `input_json Nullable(String)` / `output_json Nullable(String)`
- P5.1: `redact_payloads: bool = False` config flag on `LangSightConfig` and `LangSightClient` constructor — set `true` to suppress payload capture for PII-sensitive tools; redaction is applied before transmission (payloads never leave the host process when enabled)
- P5.1: Per-wrap `redact_payloads` override on `LangSightClient.wrap()` — allows different redaction behaviour per MCP client instance without changing the global config
- P5.1: `get_session_trace()` now returns `input_json` and `output_json` in every span row

### Added (2026-03-18 — costs API + agents dashboard)
- `GET /api/costs/breakdown` — per-tool cost breakdown endpoint
- `GET /api/costs/by-agent` — per-agent cost aggregation endpoint
- `GET /api/costs/by-session` — per-session cost aggregation endpoint
- `AgentCostEntry` and `SessionCostEntry` dataclasses in `costs/engine.py` — typed aggregation records for agent-level and session-level cost rollups
- `aggregate_cost_rows()` helper in `costs/engine.py` — shared aggregation logic used across all three cost endpoints
- `get_cost_call_counts()` method on ClickHouse backend (`storage/clickhouse.py`) — per-tool call count query
- Agents dashboard page (`dashboard/app/(dashboard)/agents/page.tsx`) — per-agent summary table showing sessions, calls, failures, total cost, duration, and unique MCP servers per agent
- Costs page upgraded to full breakdown view (`dashboard/app/(dashboard)/costs/page.tsx`) — three breakdown tables: by tool, by agent, by session
- `config_path` stored in `app.state` in `api/main.py` — routers can now access the config path without a global
- `tests/unit/test_cost_engine.py` (86 lines) and `tests/unit/api/test_costs_router.py` (134 lines) — unit coverage for new cost layer
- `tests/integration/storage/test_costs_integration.py` — integration test for `get_cost_call_counts()` against real ClickHouse

### Changed (2026-03-18 — dashboard nav and page renames)
- Dashboard sidebar nav reordered to agent-first hierarchy: Overview → Sessions → Agents → Costs → Tool Health → MCP Security (`dashboard/components/sidebar.tsx`)
- "MCP Health" dashboard page renamed to "Tool Health" (`dashboard/app/(dashboard)/health/page.tsx`) — scoping is honest: the page monitors tool-level health, not only MCP
- "Security Posture" dashboard page renamed to "MCP Security" (`dashboard/app/(dashboard)/security/page.tsx`) — scoping is honest: deep security scanning is MCP-specific

### Changed (2026-03-18 — agent-first repositioning)
- Product positioning updated from "MCP observability and security platform" to "observability platform for AI agent actions — full traces of every tool call across single and multi-agent workflows, with deep MCP health monitoring and security scanning built in." MCP remains a deep feature, not the lead identity.
- `README.md`: tagline updated to lead with agent action tracing; "Why LangSight" table reordered — agent session traces and multi-agent handoffs now first and second, cost attribution moved up to third, MCP health and security remain as fourth/fifth; NOTE callout rewritten to contrast with Langfuse/LangSmith ("what your agent thought" vs "what your agent did")
- `docs/01-product-spec.md`: One-Liner updated to agent-first framing; Elevator Pitch now opens with the primary on-call question before listing tool types; Problem Statement now leads with the agent visibility gap as the primary problem rather than MCP infrastructure
- `docs-site/introduction.mdx`: frontmatter description updated; "What is LangSight?" section now opens with the Langfuse/LangSmith contrast and the primary on-call question before explaining tool type breakdown; CardGroup card copy updated — MCP cards now explicitly scoped as "for MCP servers specifically"
- `website/app/page.tsx`: hero subheadline rewritten to lead with agent action tracing and multi-agent workflows; MCP depth framed as an additional capability, not the primary hook
- `CLAUDE.md`: "What We're Building" section updated to agent-first description



### Fixed (2026-03-18 — documentation correctness)
- `README.md`: sessions example output now matches actual CLI columns (`Session`, `Agent`, `Calls`, `Failed`, `Duration`, `Servers`) — removed non-existent `Cost` column
- `README.md`: features section and CLI reference table no longer claim `langsight sessions` shows per-session cost; cost field is absent from the current implementation
- `README.md`: architecture diagram and Phase 2 roadmap no longer list OpenAI Agents SDK integration — that file (`src/langsight/integrations/openai_agents.py`) does not exist; shipped integrations are CrewAI, Pydantic AI, LangChain/Langflow/LangGraph/LangServe, and LibreChat
- `CHANGELOG.md`: removed two references to `agent_session()` context manager — no such symbol exists in `src/`; session propagation is via explicit `session_id`/`trace_id` fields on `ToolCallSpan`
- `CHANGELOG.md`: removed OpenAI Agents SDK integration adapter entry (file never shipped)
- `PROGRESS.md`: corrected `agent_session()` context manager row to accurately describe what exists (`session_id` propagated via span fields, no context manager)
- `docs/04-implementation-plan.md`: Section 2.2 framework integration task FW.3 now references `langchain.py` (shipped) instead of `openai_agents.py` (not shipped); acceptance criteria updated accordingly
- `docs/04-implementation-plan.md`: Section 1 annotated with historical note explaining that `agentguard` CLI names and `pip install agentguard` are from the original pre-rename plan; current entry point is `langsight`

Pre-production security hardening required before 0.2.0 can be positioned as production-grade.

### Planned (Phase 7: Model-Based Cost Tracking — planned 2026-03-19)

- P7.1: `model_pricing` table (SQLite + Postgres) with `(provider, model_id, effective_from)` unique constraint; 16 seed rows for Anthropic (4 models), OpenAI (5 models), Google (3 models), Meta (2 models), AWS (2 models); `StorageBackend` protocol methods: `create_model_pricing`, `list_model_pricing`, `get_model_pricing_by_model_id`, `update_model_pricing`, `deactivate_model_pricing`; Alembic migration `add_model_pricing`
- P7.2: `input_tokens: int | None`, `output_tokens: int | None`, `model_id: str | None` fields on `ToolCallSpan`; `mcp_tool_calls` ClickHouse DDL extended with `input_tokens Nullable(UInt32)`, `output_tokens Nullable(UInt32)`, `model_id String DEFAULT ''`; OTLP parser extracts `gen_ai.usage.input_tokens`, `gen_ai.usage.output_tokens`, `gen_ai.request.model` from span attributes
- P7.3: `ModelPricingLookup` helper class in `costs/engine.py` — indexes active pricing rows by `model_id`, `cost_for()` returns 0.0 for unknown models (fail-open); cost engine routes per span: token-based for spans with `model_id` + token counts, call-based CostRule fallback otherwise; `CostEntry` gains `cost_type: "token_based" | "call_based"`; all three cost endpoints (`/breakdown`, `/by-agent`, `/by-session`) gain optional `project_id` query param; `/breakdown` response gains `llm_cost_usd` and `tool_cost_usd` top-level fields
- P7.4: `GET /api/costs/models` — list all pricing entries; `POST /api/costs/models` — add custom model (admin only); `PATCH /api/costs/models/{id}` — price update with audit trail (deactivates old row, inserts new); `DELETE /api/costs/models/{id}` — deactivate (soft delete, admin only)
- P7.5: `ModelPricingSection` component in Settings page — table grouped by provider, inline edit form, "Add custom model" modal; "Custom" badge on user-added rows; inactive rows hidden by default behind "Show history" toggle
- P7.6: Costs page gains "LLM Tokens Cost" and "Tool Calls Cost" summary cards; "Top Model" card; "By Model" table with columns: Model | Provider | Input Tokens | Output Tokens | Total Cost | % of Spend

### Planned (Phase 6: Project-Level RBAC — planned 2026-03-19)

- P6.1: Data model — `Project` and `ProjectMember` Pydantic models; `projects` + `project_members` tables (SQLite + Postgres); `project_id` column on ClickHouse `mcp_tool_calls`, `agent_slos`, `api_keys`; Alembic migration
- P6.2: Storage layer — project + member CRUD protocol methods on `StorageBackend`; implemented on `SQLiteBackend` and `PostgresBackend`; `list_projects_for_user(user_id)` for membership-scoped project lists
- P6.3: API middleware — `get_project` FastAPI dependency (global admin bypass, HTTP 404 for non-members); `require_project_role` dependency factory; new `/api/projects` router with 9 endpoints (list, create, get, rename, delete, list-members, add-member, change-role, remove-member)
- P6.4: Scope existing endpoints — optional `project_id` query param on `GET /api/agents/sessions`, reliability, costs, SLOs, and OTLP/span ingestion endpoints; compare endpoint rejects cross-project pairs with HTTP 400
- P6.5: SDK — `project_id: str | None` param on `LangSightClient.__init__()`; field on `ToolCallSpan`; propagated to every emitted span
- P6.6: Dashboard — project switcher dropdown in sidebar; active project stored in `localStorage`; all API calls scoped by `?project_id=`; Settings > Projects tab for create/invite/manage
- P6.7: Bootstrap — `_bootstrap_default_project()` creates "Default" project with admin as owner on first API startup; idempotent on subsequent restarts

### Planned (Phase 5: Deep Observability — next major phase after Security Hardening)
- Phase 5 gap analysis completed (2026-03-18): code review identified 7 missing features required for full session debugging capability
- ~~P5.1: Input/output payload capture~~ — **shipped (2026-03-18)**, see Added section above
- ~~P5.2: Session replay trace tree UI~~ — **shipped (2026-03-19)**, see Added section above
- ~~P5.3: LLM reasoning capture~~ — **shipped (2026-03-19)**, see Added section above
- ~~P5.4: Statistical anomaly detection~~ — **shipped (2026-03-19)**, see Added section above
- ~~P5.5: Agent SLO tracking~~ — **shipped (2026-03-19)**, see Added section above
- ~~P5.6: Side-by-side session comparison~~ — **shipped (2026-03-19)**, see Added section above
- ~~P5.7: Playground replay~~ — **shipped (2026-03-19)**, see Added section above

### Planned (Security Hardening S.1-S.10 — required before 0.2.0 production positioning)
- S.1: API key middleware for all API endpoints (currently unauthenticated — P0)
- S.2: RBAC — admin and viewer roles at router dependency level
- S.3: Dashboard real credential store or OIDC integration (currently demo-only — P0)
- S.4: Rate limiting on `POST /api/traces/spans` and `POST /api/traces/otlp`
- S.5: Audit logging for security-sensitive actions (scans triggered, auth failures, config changes)
- S.6: No default secrets in `docker-compose.yml` — require explicit env var injection
- S.7: ClickHouse and Postgres ports removed from host binding in compose (internal network only)
- S.8: Alembic migrations for Postgres; versioned SQL scripts for ClickHouse
- S.9: `docs/06-threat-model.md` — trust boundaries, attack surface, vulnerability disclosure policy
- S.10: Split `GET /api/status` into `/readiness` and `/liveness` for correct Kubernetes probe behavior

### Planned (Phase 4 remaining — manual deployment steps)
- R.4: Mintlify deployment — connect `docs-site/` on mintlify.com dashboard to `docs.langsight.io`
- Phase 4 website Vercel deployment — connect `website/` repo on vercel.com

- README PyPI version badge added

#### Security Assessment (2026-03-18)
- Security review completed — findings documented in `PROGRESS.md` and `docs/04-implementation-plan.md`
- P0.1: `api/main.py` — wildcard CORS, no auth on routers — any client reaching port 8000 can trigger scans and read all data
- P0.2: `dashboard/lib/auth.ts` — hardcoded users, any password accepted, static secret fallback — explicitly demo-mode only
- P1.1: `docker-compose.yml` — ClickHouse default user, default Postgres password, databases exposed to host
- P1.2: Cost engine `total` is a placeholder; per-session cost field absent from `langsight sessions` CLI output

#### CLI (8 commands)
- `langsight init` — auto-discovers Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code MCP configs
- `langsight mcp-health` — Rich table, `--json` flag, exit 1 on DOWN/DEGRADED
- `langsight security-scan` — Rich table, `--json`, `--ci` flag (exit 1 on CRITICAL)
- `langsight monitor` — continuous monitoring daemon, `--once` and `--interval` flags
- `langsight investigate` — Claude Agent SDK RCA with rule-based fallback; supports Claude, OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama

- `GET /api/agents/sessions/{session_id}` — full span tree reconstructed via `parent_span_id`
- `GET /api/health/servers` — list MCP servers with health status
- `GET /api/health/servers/{name}` — single server health detail
- `POST /api/security/scan` — trigger security scan
- `POST /api/traces/spans` — ingest `ToolCallSpan` batches from SDK and plugins
- `POST /api/traces/otlp` — ingest standard OTLP protobuf spans
- `GET /api/status` — API health and component status

#### Multi-Agent Tracing
- `parent_span_id` field on `ToolCallSpan` — enables multi-agent call tree reconstruction (same model as OpenTelemetry)
- `span_type` field on `ToolCallSpan` — `tool_call` | `agent` | `handoff`
- `agent_name` field on `ToolCallSpan` — per-agent reliability metrics
- `ToolCallSpan.agent_span()` — lifecycle spans for agent start/end events
- `ToolCallSpan.handoff_span()` — explicit spans recording agent-to-agent delegation

#### SDK
- `LangSightClient` Python SDK — 2-line MCP client instrumentation
- `wrap(mcp_client, client)` proxy — intercepts all `call_tool()` calls, records `ToolCallSpan`

#### Framework Integrations
- `LangSightCrewAICallback` — CrewAI framework adapter
- Pydantic AI integration adapter — wraps `Tool` objects at registration
- LibreChat native plugin (`integrations/librechat/langsight-plugin.js`) — `LANGSIGHT_URL` env var pattern

#### Storage Backends
- SQLite backend (default) — zero-dependency local mode, async, DDL on first open
- PostgreSQL backend — SQLAlchemy async
- ClickHouse backend — `mcp_tool_calls` table with `parent_span_id` + `span_type`, TTL 90 days, `mv_agent_sessions` materialized view

#### Infrastructure
- Docker Compose (root) — ClickHouse + PostgreSQL + OTEL Collector + API
- GitHub Actions CI — lint (ruff + mypy), unit/regression (pytest, 85% coverage gate), integration jobs

#### Docs
- `docs-site/` — 28 Mintlify pages covering all features (quickstart, CLI reference, SDK, integrations, API, self-hosting)

### Changed
- Product framing updated to "complete observability for everything an AI agent calls" — MCP servers, HTTP APIs, Python functions, and sub-agents (2026-03-17)
- One-liner updated: "LangSight is complete observability for everything an AI agent calls — MCP servers, HTTP APIs, functions, and sub-agents — with built-in health monitoring and security scanning for MCP servers."
- Capability matrix added to docs, README, and introduction page — makes explicit which features apply to all tool types vs MCP-only
- Agent session example updated in quickstart and product spec to show mixed tool types (MCP + HTTP API + function + sub-agent) in one trace tree
- Key framing documented: agent-level observability is a superset of MCP observability; `server_name` in `ToolCallSpan` is not locked to MCP servers
- `docs/01-product-spec.md`: one-liner, elevator pitch, product vision all updated with complete framing
- `docs-site/introduction.mdx`: description, hero section, capability table, and mixed session example added
- `docs-site/quickstart.mdx`: session drill-down example updated to show mixed tool types
- `README.md`: tagline, opening paragraph, and capability table added
- `PROGRESS.md`: project description at top updated to reflect final framing

### Architecture Decisions
- **All tool types observed, MCP gets proactive depth** (2026-03-17): The SDK and OTLP ingestion paths capture every call an agent makes regardless of type. The distinction is proactive vs passive: MCP servers can be pinged, listed, schema-checked, and CVE-scanned between agent sessions. Stripe, Sendgrid, and Python functions cannot — no standard protocol exists to do that. This is not a limitation; it is the accurate model of what observability can provide per tool type.

### Added
- `LangSightClient` Python SDK wrapper — 2-line MCP client instrumentation
- `wrap(mcp_client, client)` proxy — intercepts all `call_tool()` calls, records `ToolCallSpan`
- `LangSightCrewAICallback` framework adapter for CrewAI agents
- Pydantic AI integration adapter — wraps `Tool` objects at registration
- LibreChat native plugin (`integrations/librechat/langsight-plugin.js`) — LANGSIGHT_URL env var pattern, ~50 lines
- `POST /api/traces/spans` ingestion endpoint — accepts `ToolCallSpan` batches from SDK and plugins
- `langsight investigate` command — Claude Agent SDK RCA with rule-based fallback
- `parent_span_id` field on `ToolCallSpan` — enables multi-agent call tree reconstruction; same model as OpenTelemetry distributed tracing
- `span_type` field on `ToolCallSpan` — `tool_call` | `agent` | `handoff`
- `agent_name` field on `ToolCallSpan` — for per-agent reliability metrics
- Agent spans — lifecycle spans for agent start/end events
- Handoff spans — explicit spans recording agent-to-agent delegation with parent and child agent names
- `GET /api/agents/sessions` endpoint — list agent sessions with aggregated cost, call count, failure count
- `GET /api/agents/sessions/{session_id}` endpoint — full span tree for one session, reconstructed via `parent_span_id`
- `langsight sessions` CLI command — Rich table of recent sessions with cost and failures
- `langsight sessions --id <id>` — full multi-agent trace view for one session
- `mv_agent_sessions` ClickHouse materialized view (Phase 3) — pre-aggregates session-level metrics

### Changed
- Product positioning: primary value proposition is now agent session tracing and multi-agent tree visibility; MCP health monitoring and security scanning are secondary (but still unique vs competitors)
- Product one-liner updated: "LangSight is the observability layer for AI agent tool calls — traces, costs, and reliability across single and multi-agent workflows, with built-in MCP health monitoring and security scanning."
- README tagline updated to lead with agent observability
- Quickstart updated: Step 3 is now "Trace your agent sessions"; health check moved to Step 4
- `docs/01-product-spec.md`: elevator pitch, feature list, competitor table, "What We Don't Build" all updated
- `docs/04-implementation-plan.md`: Phase 2 section 2.6 added for agent sessions/multi-agent tracing; ClickHouse schema updated with `parent_span_id`, `session_id`, `agent_name`, `span_type`

### Architecture Decisions
- **Agent-observability-first pivot** (2026-03-17): Primary user question is "what did my agent call, in what order, how long did each tool take, which ones failed, what did it cost?" MCP health is a differentiating secondary feature. Repositioning does not change the roadmap — it changes the narrative and the CLI UX entry point.
- **`parent_span_id` for multi-agent trees** (2026-03-17): Using the OpenTelemetry span parent-child model rather than a proprietary tree structure. No separate tree storage needed — reconstruction is a recursive query on flat span tables. This is the same model Jaeger and Tempo use for distributed traces.
- **SDK-first before OTEL** (2026-03-17): Engineers integrate via `LangSightClient` + `wrap()` before configuring OTEL infrastructure. OTEL remains in Phase 3 for enterprise teams that already run collectors.
- **LibreChat plugin, not OTEL** (2026-03-17): LibreChat uses env vars for Langfuse integration natively; LangSight follows the same pattern rather than requiring OTEL.
- **Framework adapters alongside SDK** (2026-03-17): CrewAI/Pydantic AI users get idiomatic integration objects instead of having to find and wrap the MCP client manually.
- **LangSight is complementary to Langfuse, not competing** (2026-03-17): Langfuse traces LLM calls (prompts, completions). LangSight traces tool calls (MCP spans). They answer different questions and are used together. This distinction is now explicit in product docs and README.
